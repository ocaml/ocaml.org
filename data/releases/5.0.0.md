intro: |
  This page describes OCaml version **5.0.0**, released on
  2022-12-16. Go [here](/releases) for a list of all releases.

  This release is available as an [opam](/p/ocaml/5.0.0) package.
highlights: |
  OCaml 5.0.0 introduces a completely new runtime system
  with support for [shared memory parallelism](https://ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/parallelism.html) and [effect handlers](https://ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/effects.html).

## What's New

OCaml 5.0.0 introduces a completely new runtime system
with support for [shared memory parallelism](https://ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/parallelism.html) and [effect handlers](https://ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/effects.html).

As a language, OCaml 5 is fully compatible with OCaml 4, down to the performance
characteristics of your programs. In other words, any code that works with OCaml 4 should work the same with OCaml 5. 

The currently known exceptions to this rule are:
- The removal of many long-deprecated functions and modules
- Changes to the internal runtime API
- The performance of ephemerons is currently (and temporarily) strongly degraded

For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimisations, etc., please consult the
[changelog](#Changes).

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0
```
It might be also interesting to check the new support for parallelism by installing the `domainslib` library with
```bash
opam install domainslib
```
The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.0.0.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.0/ocaml-5.0.0.tar.gz)


### Configuration Options

The configuration of the installed opam switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- `ocaml-option-afl`: set OCaml to be compiled with `afl-fuzz` instrumentation
- `ocaml-option-bytecode-only`: compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- `ocaml-option-flambda`: set OCaml to be compiled with `flambda` activated
- `ocaml-option-musl`: set OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc`
- `ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array`: set OCaml to be compiled with `--disable-flat-float-array`
- `ocaml-option-static`: set OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc -static`
- `ocaml-option-address-sanitizer`: set OCaml to be compiled with address sanitiser
- `ocaml-option-leak-sanitizer`: set OCaml to be compiled with leak sanitiser


For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with

```
opam switch create 5.0.0+flambda+nnpchecker --package=ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

or with opam 2.1:

```
opam switch create 5.0.0+flambda+nnpchecker ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```
