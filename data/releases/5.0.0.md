## What's new

OCaml 5.0.0 introduces a completely new runtime system
with support for shared memory parallelism and effect handlers. 

For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the
[changelog](#Changes).

Configuration options
---------------------

The configuration of the installed opam switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- ocaml-option-afl: set OCaml to be compiled with afl-fuzz instrumentation
- ocaml-option-bytecode-only: compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- ocaml-option-flambda: set OCaml to be compiled with flambda activated
- ocaml-option-musl: set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc
- ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array: set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-flat-float-array
- ocaml-option-static :set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc -static
- ocaml-option-address-sanitizer: set OCaml to be compiled with address sanitizer
- ocaml-option-leak-sanitizer: set OCaml to be compiled with leak sanitizer


For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with

```
opam switch create 5.0.0+flambda+nnpchecker --package=ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

or with opam 2.1:

```
opam switch create 5.0.0+flambda+nnpchecker ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.
