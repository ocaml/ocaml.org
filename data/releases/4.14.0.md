kind: compiler
version: 4.14.0
date: 2022-03-28
intro: |
  This page describes OCaml version **4.14.0**, released on
  2022-03-28. Go [here](/releases) for a list of all releases.

  This release is available as an [opam](/p/ocaml/4.14.0) package.

  As the last version of OCaml 4, the 4.14 branch of OCaml will be maintained during the transition period for OCaml 5.
  During this period, OCaml 4.14 will receive episodic bugfix updates as a long term support branch until at least 2024.
highlights: |
  Some of the highlights in OCaml 4.14.0 are:

  - Integrated support for "go to definitions" in Merlin.
  - Standard library: new modules In_channel and Out_channel,
    many new functions in Seq module, UTF decoding and validation support
    for strings and bytes.
  - Runtime optimisation: GC prefetching. Benchmarks show a speedup of around 20%
    in GC-heavy programs.
  - Improved error messages in particular for module-level error.
  - Deprecated functions and modules in preparation for OCaml 5.
    In particular, the Stream and Genlex modules are now deprecated.
  - Type variables can be explicitly introduced in value and variant constructor
    declarations. For instance,
    ```ocaml
        val fold: ('acc -> 'elt -> 'acc) -> 'acc -> 'elt list -> 'acc
        type showable = Show: 'a * ('a -> string) -> showable
    ```
    can now be written as
    ```ocaml
        val fold: 'acc 'elt. ('acc -> 'elt -> 'acc) -> 'acc -> 'elt list -> 'acc
        type showable = Show: 'a. 'a * ('a -> string) -> showable
    ```
  - Tail-call with up to 64 arguments are now guaranteed to be optimized
    for all architectures.
  - Experimental tail modulo cons (TMC) transformation

[changelog](#Changes).

Configuration options
---------------------

The configuration of the installed opam switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- ocaml-option-32bit: set OCaml to be compiled in 32-bit mode for 64-bit Linux and OS X hosts
- ocaml-option-afl: set OCaml to be compiled with afl-fuzz instrumentation
- ocaml-option-bytecode-only: compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- ocaml-option-default-unsafe-string: set OCaml to be compiled without safe strings by default
- ocaml-option-flambda: set OCaml to be compiled with flambda activated
- ocaml-option-fp: set OCaml to be compiled with frame-pointers enabled
- ocaml-option-musl: set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc
- ocaml-option-nnp : set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-naked-pointers
- ocaml-option-nnpchecker: set OCaml to be compiled with --enable-naked-pointers-checker
- ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array: set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-flat-float-array
- ocaml-option-static :set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc -static

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with

```
opam switch create 4.14.0+flambda+nnpchecker --package=ocaml-variants.4.14.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

or with opam 2.1:

```
opam switch create 4.14.0+flambda+nnpchecker ocaml-variants.4.14.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

* (*breaking change*) [#10627](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10627): Make row_field abstract
  Completes [#10474](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10474) by making row_field abstract too.
  An immutable view row_field_view is provided, and one converts between it
  and row_field via inj_row_field and row_field_repr.

  -Wl,-z,notext in mksharedlib and mkmaindll. Fixes relocation issues, reported

### Bug fixes:

- [#9214](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9214), [#10709](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10709): Wrong unmarshaling of function pointers in debugger mode.

   Vincent Laviron)

- [#10473](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10473): Add CFI directives to RISC-V runtime and asmcomp.

  (Edwin Török, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär and Xavier Leroy)

- [#10539](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10539): Field kinds should be kept when copying types
  Losing the sharing meant that one could desynchronize them between several
  occurrences of self, allowing a method to be both public and hidden,
  which broke type soundness.
  (Jacques Garrigue, review by Leo White)

  rather than a basename.
  (David Allsopp, report by Fabian @copy, review by Gabriel Scherer)
