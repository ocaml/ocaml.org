## What's new

After careful consideration and extensive research, we are pleased to announce that OCaml is undergoing a [spectacular rebranding effort](/news/ocaml-5.0.0~camelope). To celebrate this momentous occasion, the OCaml team has put together a limited edition release of the language, called “OCaml Camelope Edition”. This edition comes with a set of new features that are truly groundbreaking:

* **Time-traveling type checker**: The type checker can now predict and fix your type errors even before you write the code! Thanks to advanced machine learning algorithms, the type checker can predict the types of your variables and functions with stunning accuracy, saving you hours of debugging time. Just sit back, relax, and let the type checker do its magic.

* **Telepathic REPL**: Just think about your code, and the REPL will execute it for you – no need to type! Thanks to breakthroughs in brain-computer interface technology, the OCaml REPL can now read your thoughts and translate them into executable code. Whether you're on the go or just feeling lazy, the telepathic REPL is the ultimate tool for maximum productivity.

* **Infinite loop optimizer**: The compiler will now optimize infinite loops to run in constant time! Thanks to a revolutionary new algorithm, the OCaml compiler can now detect infinite loops and automatically optimize them to run in constant time. Whether you're working on a computationally-intensive project or just trying to impress your friends, the infinite loop optimizer is a must-have feature for any serious OCaml developer.

(Disclaimer: These release notes are an April Fools’ joke. The OCaml team has not introduced a new mascot, nor are there any plans for an “OCaml Camelope Edition” or the features mentioned above. We hope this post brought a smile to your face, and we encourage you to enjoy the spirit of April Fools’ Day! Happy coding!)
