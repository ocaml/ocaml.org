## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.1
```

### Configuration Options

The configuration of the installed [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- `ocaml-option-afl`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `afl-fuzz` instrumentation
- `ocaml-option-bytecode-only`: Compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- `ocaml-option-flambda`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `flambda` activated
- `ocaml-option-musl`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc`
- `ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `--disable-flat-float-array`
- `ocaml-option-static`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc -static`
- `ocaml-option-address-sanitizer`: Set OCaml to be compiled with address sanitiser
- `ocaml-option-leak-sanitizer`: Set OCaml to be compiled with leak sanitiser
- `ocaml-option-fp`: Set OCaml to be compiled with frame pointers

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the `--disable-flat-float-array` option with

```
opam switch create 5.1.0+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```


Source Distribution
-------------------

- [Source
  tarball](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.1.tar.gz)
  (`.tar.gz`) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and macOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).
- Also available in
  [`.zip`](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.1.zip)
  format.
- [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.
- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The
[INSTALL](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.1/notes/INSTALL.adoc) file
of the distribution provides detailed compilation and installation
instructions. See also the [Windows release
notes](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.1/notes/README.win32.adoc) for
instructions on how to build under Windows.

## Changes 


This is the
[changelog](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.1/notes/Changes).
(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "Breaking Change" warning)


### Standard library:

* (*Breaking Change*) [#12562](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12562), [#12734](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12734), [#12783](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12783): Remove the `Marshal.Compression` flag to the
  `Marshal.to_*` functions introduced in 5.1 by [#12006](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12006), as it cannot
  be implemented without risking to link `-lzstd` with all
  `ocamlopt`-generated executables. The compilers are still able to use
  ZSTD compression for compilation artefacts.

   Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Kate Deplaix, and Damien Doligez).
