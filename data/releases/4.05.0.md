## Source distribution

- [Source
  tarball](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.05.0.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).

- Also available in
  [.zip](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.05.0.zip)
  format.

- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.

- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The [INSTALL](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/4.05/notes/INSTALL.adoc)
file of the distribution provides detailed compilation and
installation instructions -- see also the [Windows release
notes](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/4.05/notes/README.win32.adoc) for instructions on how to build under Windows.

## Alternative Compilers

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.

* [Bucklescript](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/ - [404 Not Found]) is a newer
  OCaml to JavaScript compiler. See its
  [wiki](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/wiki/Differences-from-js_of_ocaml)
  for an explanation of how it differs from js_of_ocaml.

* [OCaml-java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a stable OCaml to
  Java compiler.
