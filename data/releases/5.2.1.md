## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.2.1
```

### Configuration Options

The configuration of the installed [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- `ocaml-option-afl`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `afl-fuzz` instrumentation
- `ocaml-option-bytecode-only`: Compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- `ocaml-option-flambda`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `flambda` activated
- `ocaml-option-musl`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc`
- `ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `--disable-flat-float-array`
- `ocaml-option-static`: Set OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc -static`
- `ocaml-option-address-sanitizer`: Set OCaml to be compiled with address sanitiser
- `ocaml-option-leak-sanitizer`: Set OCaml to be compiled with leak sanitiser
- `ocaml-option-fp`: Set OCaml to be compiled with frame pointers

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the `--disable-flat-float-array` option with

```
opam switch create 5.2.1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.2.1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

## Changes 


This is the [changelog](https://ocaml.org/releases/5.2/notes/Changes).

- [#13207](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13207): Be sure to reload the register caching the exception handler in
  caml_c_call and caml_c_call_stack_args, as its value may have been changed
  if the OCaml stack is expanded during a callback.
  (Miod Vallat, report by Vesa Karvonen, review by Gabriel Scherer and
   Xavier Leroy)

- [#13252](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13252): Rework register assignment in the interpreter code on m68k on Linux,
  due to the %a5 register being used by Glibc.
  (Miod Vallat, report by Stéphane Glondu, review by Gabriel Scherer and
   Xavier Leroy)

- [#13268](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13268): Fix a call to test in configure.ac that was causing errors when
  LDFLAGS contains several words.
  (Stéphane Glondu, review by Miod Vallat)

- [#13234](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13234), [#13267](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13267): Open runtime events file in read-write mode on armel
  (armv5) systems due to atomic operations limitations on that
  platform.
  (Stéphane Glondu, review by Miod Vallat and Vincent Laviron)

- [#13188](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13188): fix races in the FFI code coming from the use of Int_val(...)
  on rooted values inside blocking questions / without the runtime lock.
  (Calling Int_val(...) on non-rooted immediates is fine, but any
   access to rooted values must be done outside blocking sections /
   with the runtime lock.)
  (Etienne Millon, review by Gabriel Scherer, Jan Midtgaard, Olivier Nicole)

- [#13318](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13318): Fix regression in GC alarms, and fix them for flambda.
  (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, report by Benjamin Monate, review
