## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 4.14.1
```

### Configuration Options

The configuration of the installed [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- `ocaml-option-afl`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `afl-fuzz` instrumentation
- `ocaml-option-bytecode-only`: compiles OCaml without the native-code compiler
- `ocaml-option-flambda`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `flambda` activated
- `ocaml-option-musl`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc`
- `ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `--disable-flat-float-array`
- `ocaml-option-static`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc -static`
- `ocaml-option-32bit`: sets OCaml to be compiled in 32-bit mode for 64-bit Linux and OS X hosts
- `ocaml-option-nnp`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `--disable-naked-pointers`
- `ocaml-option-nnpchecker`: set OCaml to be compiled with `--enable-naked-pointers-checker`
- `ocaml-option-fp`: sets OCaml to be compiled with frame-pointers enabled

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with

```
opam switch create 4.14.1+flambda+nnpchecker --package=ocaml-variants.4.14.1+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

or with opam 2.1:

```
opam switch create 4.14.1+flambda+nnpchecker ocaml-variants.4.14.1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```
