  This page describes OCaml version **4.14.2**, released on
  Mar 14, 2024. Go [here](/releases) for a list of all releases.

  This is a bug-fix release of [OCaml 4.14.1](/releases/4.14.1).

  As the last version of OCaml 4, the 4.14 branch of OCaml will be maintained during the transition period for OCaml 5.
  During this period, OCaml 4.14 will receive episodic bugfix updates as a long term support branch until at least 2024.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 4.14.2
```

### Configuration Options

The configuration of the installed [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- `ocaml-option-afl`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `afl-fuzz` instrumentation
- `ocaml-option-bytecode-only`: compiles OCaml without the native-code compiler
- `ocaml-option-flambda`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `flambda` activated
- `ocaml-option-musl`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc`
- `ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `--disable-flat-float-array`
- `ocaml-option-static`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `musl-gcc -static`
- `ocaml-option-32bit`: sets OCaml to be compiled in 32-bit mode for 64-bit Linux and OS X hosts
- `ocaml-option-nnp`: sets OCaml to be compiled with `--disable-naked-pointers`
- `ocaml-option-nnpchecker`: set OCaml to be compiled with `--enable-naked-pointers-checker`
- `ocaml-option-fp`: sets OCaml to be compiled with frame-pointers enabled

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with:


```
opam switch create 4.14.2+flambda+nnpchecker ocaml-variants.4.14.2+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```
