The release of OCaml 5.4.0 is imminent.

As a final step, we are publishing a release candidate to check that everything is in order before the release in the upcoming week.

If you find any bugs, please report them on the [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Compared to the second beta, this release candidate only contains a fix in the TSAN mode, and one metadata fix in the changelog itself. The full change log for OCaml 5.4.0 is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.4/Changes).

Happy hacking,  
Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team.

## Installation instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:

```
opam update
opam switch create 5.4.0~rc1
```

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

- GitHub: [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.4.0-rc1.tar.gz](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.4.0-rc1.tar.gz)
- OCaml archives at Inria: [https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.4/ocaml-5.4.0~rc1.tar.gz](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.4/ocaml-5.4.0~rc1.tar.gz)

## Fine-tuned compiler configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.4.0~rc1+options <option_list>
```

where `<option_list>` is a space-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:

```
opam switch create 5.4.0~rc1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.4.0~rc1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
