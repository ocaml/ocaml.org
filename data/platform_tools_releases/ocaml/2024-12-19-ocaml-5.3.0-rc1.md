changelog: |
  ## Changes since the second beta
  
  ### Type system
  
  - [#13690](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13690): some type expressions were incorrectly not generalized (because they
     were assigned to the wrong level pool)
  
  ### Documentation
  
  - [#13666](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13666): Rewrite parts of the example code around nested lists in Chapter 6
    (Polymorphism and its limitations -> Polymorphic recursion) giving the
    "depth" function [in the non-polymorphically-recursive part of the example]
    a much more sensible behavior; also fix a typo and some formatting.
    (Frank Steffahn, review by Florian Angeletti)
  
  ### Compiler user-interface and warnings:
  
  - [#12084](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12084), +[#13669](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13669), +[#13673](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13673): Check link order when creating archive and when using
     ocamlopt.

The release of OCaml 5.3.0 is imminent.
As a final step, we are publishing a release candidate to check that everything is in order before the release in the upcoming week(s).

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Compared to the second beta, this release candidate contains a regression fix in the type system (some type expressions were not generalized when they ought to be), one fix for the new check for dependency order at link time, and a manual update.

The full change log for OCaml 5.3.0 is available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.3/Changes). A short summary of the
changes since the second beta release is also available below.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.3.0~rc1
```

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.3.0-rc1.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.3/ocaml-5.3.0~rc1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.3.0~rc1+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a space-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.3.0~rc1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.3.0~rc1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
