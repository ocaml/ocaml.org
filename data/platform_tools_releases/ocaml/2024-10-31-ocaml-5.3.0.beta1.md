One month and half after the release of the first alpha for OCaml 5.3.0, 
the release of OCaml 5.3.0 is drawing near.

The internal API of the compiler libraries has been frozen, and most core
developer tools support (or will support soon) the new version of the compiler.

We have thus released a first beta version of OCaml 5.3.0 to help you update
your software and libraries ahead of the release (see below for the
installation instructions). More information about the whole release process is
now available in the [compiler repository](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/release-info/introduction.md).

Compared to the first alpha release, this beta contains a few runtime or
typechecker fixes, a handful of fixes for the runtime event library and other
miscellaneous fixes.

Exceptionally, this beta release also introduces a new flag `-keywords` for the
compiler. This backward compatibility flag aims to help compiling old code that
are using `effect` as a normal identifier, now that `effect` is a keyword in the
new effect handler syntax.

The progresses on stabilising the ecosystem are tracked on the [opam readiness for 5.3.0 meta-issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/26596).

The full release is expected in the end of November or beginning of December,
see the [new prospective
calendar](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/release-info/calendar.md)
for more information.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

If you are interested in full list of features and bug fixes of the new OCaml
version, the updated change log for OCaml 5.3.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.3/Changes).

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1 and later:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.3.0~beta1
```

The source code for the beta is also available at these addresses:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.3.0-beta1.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.3/ocaml-5.3.0~beta1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.3.0~beta1+options <option_list>
```

where `option_list` is a space separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a flambda and no-flat-float-array switch:

```bash
opam switch create 5.3.0~beta1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.3.0~beta1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
