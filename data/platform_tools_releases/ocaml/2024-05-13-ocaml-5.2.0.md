  ### Restored and New Backends:

  - [#12276](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12276), [#12601](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12601): Native-code compilation for POWER (64 bits, little-endian)
    (Xavier Leroy, review by KC Sivaramakrishnan, Anil Madhavapeddy,
     and Stephen Dolan)

  - [#12667](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12667): Extend the latter to POWER 64 bits, big-endian, ELFv2 ABI
    (A. Wilcox, review by Xavier Leroy)

  ### Runtime System:

  - [#12193](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12193): Reintroduce GC compaction for shared pools.
    Adds a parallel compactor for the shared pools (which contain major heap
    blocks sized less than 128 words). Explicit only for now, on calls to
    `Gc.compact`.
    (Sadiq Jaffer, Nick Barnes, review by Anil Madhavapeddy, Damien Doligez,
     David Allsopp, Miod Vallat, Artem Pianykh, Stephen Dolan, Mark Shinwell,
     and KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  - [#12114](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12114): Add ThreadSanitizer support
    (Fabrice Buoro and Olivier Nicole, based on an initial work by Anmol Sahoo,
     review by Damien Doligez, Sébastien Hinderer, Jacques-Henri Jourdan, Luc
     Maranget, Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, Gabriel Scherer)


  - [#12850](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12850): Update `Gc.quick_stat` data at the end of major cycles and compaction.
    This PR adds an additional `caml_collect_gc_stats_sample_stw` to the major heap
    cycling STW. This means that `Gc.quick_stat` now actually reflects the state of
    the heap after a major cycle or compaction.
    (Sadiq Jaffer, review by Miod Vallat and Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#12859](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12859): Ensure `Gc.compact` does a full major before the compactor runs
    (Sadiq Jaffer, review by Leo White, Mark Shinwell, Gabriel Scherer,
     Josh Berdine, David Allsopp, and KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  - [#10111](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10111): Increase the detail of location information for debugging events to
    allow the end-line number and character offset to be reported.
    (David Allsopp, review by Nick Barnes, Enguerrand Decorne and Stephen Dolan)

  - [#10403](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10403), [#12202](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12202): Introduce `caml_ext_table_add_noexc` that does not
    raise `Out_of_memory` exceptions, and use it inside the blocking sections
    of `caml_read_directory`.  Also, check for overflows in EXT table sizes.
    (Xavier Leroy, report by Arseniy Alekseyev, review by Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11332](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11332), [#12702](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12702): Make sure `Bool_val(v)` has type `bool` in C++
    (Xavier Leroy, report by ygrek, review by Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#12772](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12772), [#12787](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12787): Avoid using `_Bool` in public headers for the sake of C++
    compatibility
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, report by KC Sivaramakrishnan, review
    by Xavier Leroy and KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  - [#12223](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12223): Constify constructors and flags tables in C code. Now these
    tables will go in the read-only segment where they belong.
    (Antonin Décimo, review by Gabriel Scherer and Xavier Leroy)

    a lighter alternative to `CAMLnoreturn_start` / `CAMLnoreturn_end`.
    Implement it so as to conform with C11, C23, C++11, C++17.
    (Xavier Leroy and Dhruv Maroo, with help from Antonin Décimo, review by
     Gabriel Scherer and David Allsopp)

  - [#12275](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12275): `caml/stack.h`: More abstract macros to describe OCaml stacks and
    how to traverse them, supporting more stack layouts.
    (Xavier Leroy, review by KC Sivaramakrishnan and Fabrice Buoro)

  - [#12268](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12268): Deliver `Out_of_memory` exception if domain creation fails
    due to memory resource exhaustion. Previously, it was always a `Failure`.
    (Anil Madhavapeddy, review by David Allsopp)

    delayed pending action. This ensures that one can reason within the
    FFI that no mutation happens on the same domain when allocating on
    the OCaml heap from C, consistently with OCaml 4. This also fixes
    further bugs with the Multicore systhreads implementation.
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, bug reports and suggestion by Mark
     Shinwell, review by Nick Barnes and Stephen Dolan)

  - [#11307](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11307): Finish adapting the implementation of asynchronous actions for
    Multicore: soundness, liveness, and performance issues.
    Do not crash if a signal handler is called from an unregistered C
    thread and other possible soundness issues. Prevent issues where joins
    on other domains could make the toplevel unresponsive to Ctrl-C. Avoid
    needless repeated polling in C code when callbacks cannot run
    immediately.
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Enguerrand Decorne, Xavier
    Leroy, and KC Sivaramakrishnan)

    interpreter.  Either fix their types, mark them as `CAMLexport` instead of
    `CAMLprim`, or remove them entirely if no longer used.
    (Xavier Leroy, review by David Allsopp)

    ```
      module A = struct
        type t = int
        type r = unit
        type s = string
      end

      type example = A.(t * r * s)

    a single `\n` character during lexing to guarantee that the semantics
    of newlines in string literals are not modified by Windows tools
    transforming `\n` into `\r\n` in source files.
    Warning 29 [eol-in-string] is not emitted anymore, as the normalisation
    gives more robust semantics to newlines in string literals.
    (Gabriel Scherer and Damien Doligez, review by Daniel Bünzli, David
     Allsopp, Andreas Rossberg, Xavier Leroy, report by Andreas Rossberg)

  ### Standard Library:

  - [#11563](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11563): Add the Dynarray module to the `stdlib`. Dynamic arrays are

    `Marshal.to_*` functions.  The compilers are still able to use
    ZSTD compression for compilation artefacts.
    This is a forward port and clean-up of the emergency fix that was introduced

     and Stefan Muenzel, RFC by François Bobot)


  * (*Breaking Change*) [#10613](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10613), [#12405](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12405): Simplify the values used for the system variable (`system:` in
    `ocamlopt -config` or the `Config.system` constant). In particular, s390x and
    ppc64 now report "linux" instead of "elf"; all variants of 32-bit ARM on Linux
    now report "linux"; OpenBSD now reports "openbsd" instead of "bsd" for 32-bit
    ARM; FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD now report the same value for both x86_64 and
    x86_32; x86_32 systems matching *BSD but not FreeBSD*, NetBSD*, or OpenBSD*
    are no longer identified (as on x86_64); x86_32 Linux now reports "linux"

  ### Internal/`compiler-libs` Changes:

  - [#12508](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12508) : Add compiler-side support for project-wide occurrences in Merlin by
    generating index tables of all identifier occurrences. This extra data in `.cmt`
    files is only added when the new flag `-bin-annot-occurrences` is passed.
    (Ulysse Gérard, Nathanaëlle Courant, suggestions by Gabriel Scherer and Thomas
    Refis, review by Florian Angeletti, Gabriel Scherer, and Thomas Refis)

  - [#12236](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12236), [#12386](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12386), [#12391](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12391), [#12496](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12496), [#12673](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12673): Use syntax as sole determiner of arity.
    This changes function arity to be based solely on the source program's
    parsetree. Previously, the heuristic for arity had more subtle heuristics
    that involved type information about patterns. Function arity is important
    because it determines when a pattern match's effects run and is an input
    into the fast path for function application.

    This change affects tooling; it changes the function constructs in parsetree
    and typedtree.

  * (*Breaking Change*) [#12145](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12145): Loopy constraints cause `ocamlc` to loop.
    Fixed by completely removing the call to `update_type` in
    `Typedecl.transl_type_decl`, as the expansion is already checked by
    `check_regularity`. As a result, recursion is more polymorphic,
    which may cause some (essentially wrong) type declarations to have
    unbound type variables and some constraints unrelated to the concrete
    type to be ignored (see tests/typing-misc/constraints.ml).

---

We have the pleasure of celebrating Inge Lehmann's birthday by announcing the
release of OCaml version 5.2.0.

Some of the highlights in OCaml 5.2.0 are:
- Reintroduced GC compaction
- Restored native backend for POWER 64 bits
- Thread sanitiser support
- New Dynarray module
- New `-H` flag for hidden include directories
- Project-wide occurrence metadata support for developer tools
- Raw identifiers
- Local open in type expressions

And a lot of incremental changes:
- Around 20 new functions in the standard library
- Many fixes and improvements in the runtime
- Many bug fixes

OCaml 5.2.0 is still a somewhat experimental release compared to the OCaml
4.14 branch. In particular:

   - The Windows MSVC port is still unavailable.
   - Ephemeron performances need to be investigated.
   - `statmemprof` is being tested in the developer branch.
   - There are a number of known runtime concurrency or GC performance bugs
     (that trigger under rare circumstances).

Since the Windows MSVC port and `statmemprof` are still missing, the maintenance
support for OCaml 4.14 will be extended until at least the end of the year.

Please report any unexpected behaviours on the [OCaml issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues)
and post any questions or comments you might have on our
[discussion forums](https://discuss.ocaml.org).


The full list of changes can be found in the changelog below.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.2.0
```

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.2.0.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.2/ocaml-5.2.0.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.2.0+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a space separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.2.0+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```
