    *   merlin library
        *   Expose utilities to manipulate typed-holes in `Merlin_analysis.Typed_hole`  
            ([#1888](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1888))
        *   `locate` can now disambiguate between files with identical names and contents  
            ([#1882](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1882))
        *   `occurrences` now reports stale files ([#1885](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1885))
        *   `inlay-hints` fix inlay hints on function parameters ([#1923](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1923))
        *   Fix issues with ident validation and Lid comparison for occurrences ([#1924](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1924))
        *   Handle class type in outline ([#1932](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1932))
        *   Handle locally defined value in outline ([#1936](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1936))

        *   Downstreamed a typer fix from 5.3.X that would trigger assertions linked  
            to scopes bit masks when backtracking the typer cache ([#1935](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1935))
        *   Add a new selection field to outline results that contains the location of  
            the symbol itself. ([#1942](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1942))
        *   Fix destruct hanging when printing patterns with (::). ([#1944](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1944), fixes

            fixes [#1580](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1580) and [#1588](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1588), workaround for [#1934](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1934))
    *   ocaml-index
        *   Improve the granularity of index reading by segmenting the marshalization  
            of the involved data-structures. ([#1889](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1889))
    *   test suite
        *   Add a test case illustrating wrong open order proposed in issue [#1900](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1900). ([#1901](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1901))

Merlin `5.5-503` is now available! This release addresses several long-standing issues with jump-to-definition, occurrences reporting, and inlay hints while adding new utilities for working with typed holes.

Key changes include enhanced `locate` functionality that can now disambiguate between files with identical names and contents, fixes to `occurrences` that properly report stale files, and corrected inlay hints on function parameters. The outline feature has been expanded to handle class types and locally defined values, with a new selection field that provides the exact location of symbols. Several jump-to-definition issues have been resolved, and the destruct feature no longer hangs when processing patterns with the cons operator (::).

The merlin library now exposes utilities for manipulating typed holes through `Merlin_analysis.Typed_hole`, and ocaml-index has improved performance through better granularity in index reading via segmented marshalization. This release also includes fixes for typer assertion failures and cache backtracking issues that were causing crashes in certain scenarios.
