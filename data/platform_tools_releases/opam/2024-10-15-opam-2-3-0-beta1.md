_Feedback on this post is welcome on [Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-3-0-beta1/15450)!_

We're happy to announce the first beta release of opam 2.3.0.
Compared to the previous 2.3.0\~alpha1 release, you can view the full list of changes in the
[release note](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.3.0-beta1).

This version is a beta, so we invite users to test it to spot previously
unnoticed bugs as we head towards the stable release.

## Changes

* Fix an opam 2.1 regression where the initial pin of a local VCS directory would store untracked and ignored files.
  Those files would usually be cleaned before building the package; however, Git submodules would not be cleaned and would cause issues when paired with the new behaviour added in 2.3.0\~alpha1, which makes an opam error when Git submodules fail to update (it was previously a warning). ([#5809](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5809))

* Fix a regression which would make opam crash on platforms where `getconf LONG_BIT` is not available (e.g., OpenBSD). ([#6215](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6215))

* Fix the installed packages internal cache, which was storing the wrong version of the opam file after a build failure.
  This could be triggered easily for users with custom repositories with non-populated extra-files. ([#6213](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6213))

* Fix a regression in lint W59 with local URLs that are not archives. ([#6218](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6218))

* Fix the compilation of opam on Windows with OCaml >= 5.0 (again)

* Several improvements to the prebuilt release binaries were made:
  * The Linux binaries are now built on Alpine 3.20
  * The FreeBSD binary is now built on FreeBSD 14.1
  * The OpenBSD binary is now built on OpenBSD 7.6 and loses support for OpenBSD 7.5 and older
  * A Linux/riscv64 binary is now available

API changes are denoted in the release note linked above.
This release also includes a couple of PRs improving and extending the tests.

## Try It!

The upgrade instructions are unchanged:

1. Either from binaries: run

For Unix systems
```
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh) --version 2.3.0~beta1"
```
or from PowerShell for Windows systems
```
Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://opam.ocaml.org/install.ps1) } -Version 2.3.0~beta1"
```
or download manually from [the GitHub "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.3.0-beta1) to your PATH.

2. Or from source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.3.0-beta1#compiling-this-repo).


You should then run:
```
opam init --reinit -ni
```


Please report any issues to [the bug-tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).

Happy hacking!
