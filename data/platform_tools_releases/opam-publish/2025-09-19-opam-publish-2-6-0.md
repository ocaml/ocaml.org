We are happy to announce the release of opam-publish 2.6.0, which brings opam-publish closer to the ability to more easily publish your releases automatically.
This release brings:
- A new `OPAM_PUBLISH_GH_TOKEN` environment variable and `--token` argument are now available to pass the GitHub token, thanks to [@filipeom](https://github.com/filipeom)
- The addition of a message after the PR is open, to notify users that they can re-run opam-publish to update the PR, thanks to [@punchagan](https://github.com/punchagan)

Happy publishing!
