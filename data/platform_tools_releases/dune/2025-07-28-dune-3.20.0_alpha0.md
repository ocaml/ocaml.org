    ### Fixed

    *   Stop re-running cram tests after promotion when it's not necessary ([#11994](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11994),  
        [@rgrinberg](https://github.com/rgrinberg))
        
    *   fix: `$ dune subst` should not fail when adding the version field in opam  
        files ([#11801](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11801), fixes [#11045](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/11045), [@btjorge](https://github.com/btjorge))
        
    *   Kill all processes in the process group after the main process has  
        terminated; in particular this avoids background processes in cram tests to  
        stick around after the test finished ([#11841](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11841), fixes [#11820](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/11820), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter),  
        [@Leonidas-from-XIV](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV))
        

    ### Added

    *   `(tests)` stanzas now generate aliases with the test name. To run  
        `(test (name a))` you can do `dune build @runtest-a`. ([#11558](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11558), grants part of [#10239](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/10239),  
        [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter))
        
    *   Inline test libraries now produce aliases `runtest-name_of_lib`  
        allowing users to run specific inline tests as `dune build @runtest-name_of_lib`. ([#11109](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11109), partially fixes [#10239](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/10239), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter))
        
    *   feature: `$ dune subst` use version from `dune-project` when no version  
        control repository has been detected ([#11801](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11801), [@btjorge](https://github.com/btjorge))
        
    *   Allow `dune exec` to run concurrently with another instance of dune in watch  
        mode ([#11840](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11840), [@gridbugs](https://github.com/gridbugs))
        
    *   Introduce `%{os}`, `%{os_version}`, `%{os_distribution}`, and `%{os_family}`  
        percent forms. These have the same values as their opam counterparts.  
        ([#11863](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11863), [@rgrinberg](https://github.com/rgrinberg))
        
    *   Introduce option `(implicit_transitive_deps false-if-hidden-includes-supported)`  
        that is equivalent to `(implicit_transitive_deps false)` when `-H` is  
        supported by the compiler (OCaml >= 5.2) and equivalent to  
        `(implicit_transitive_deps true)` otherwise. ([#11866](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11866), fixes [#11212](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/11212), [@nojb](https://github.com/nojb))
        
    *   Add `dune describe location` for printing the path to the executable that  
        would be run ([#11905](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11905), [@gridbugs](https://github.com/gridbugs))
        
    *   `dune runtest` can now understand absolute paths as well as run tests in  
        specific build contexts ([#11936](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11936), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter)).
        
    *   Added 'empty' alias which contains no targets. ([#11556](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11556) [#11952](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11952) [#11955](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11955) [#11956](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11956),  
        grants [#4161](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/4161), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter) and [@rgrinberg](https://github.com/rgrinberg))
        
    *   Allow `dune promote` to properly run while a watch mode server is running  
        ([#12010](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/12010), [@ElectreAAS](https://github.com/ElectreAAS))
        
    *   Add `--alias` and `--alias-rec` flags as an alternative to the `@` and `@@`  
        syntax in the command line ([#12043](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/12043), fixes [#5775](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/5775), [@rgrinberg](https://github.com/rgrinberg))
        

    ### Changed

    *   Format long lists in s-expressions to fill the line instead of  
        formatting them in a vertical way ([#10892](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10892), fixes [#10860](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/10860), [@nojb](https://github.com/nojb))
        
    *   Switch from MD5 to BLAKE3 for digesting targets and rules. BLAKE3 is both more  
        performant and difficult to break than MD5 ([#11735](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11735), [@rgrinberg](https://github.com/rgrinberg), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter))
        
    *   Print a warning when `dune build` runs over RPC ([#11836](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/11836), [@gridbugs](https://github.com/gridbugs))
        
    *   Stop emitting empty module group wrapper `.js` file in `melange.emit`  
        ([#11987](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11987), fixes [#11986](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11986), [@anmonteiro](https://github.com/anmonteiro))

Dune 3.20.0~alpha0 is now available with several user-facing improvements and fixes.

## Summary of Changes

**Testing improvements:** Individual tests can now be run using named aliases (`@runtest-<name>`), `dune runtest` accepts absolute paths and can target specific build contexts, and cram tests have better process cleanup.

**New command-line features:** `dune exec` works concurrently with watch mode, `dune promote` runs while watch mode is active, `dune describe location` shows executable paths, and `--alias`/`--alias-rec` flags provide alternatives to `@`/`@@` syntax.

**New variables:** Added `%{os}`, `%{os_version}`, `%{os_distribution}`, and `%{os_family}` variables matching opam equivalents.

**Fixes:** `dune subst` properly handles version fields in opam files and works when no version control is detected.

**Under the hood:** Switched from MD5 to BLAKE3 for better performance, improved s-expression formatting, and added smart handling of transitive dependencies based on compiler capabilities.

## Installation

```
opam install dune.3.20.0~alpha0
```

This is an alpha release for testing. Report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/dune).
