Following the release of Dune 3.11.0 a few days ago, we've just released version
3.11.1 with a couple of bug fixes:

- Fix the `dune rpc status` command that was incorrectly showing that there were
  no RPC servers running on Windows.
- Fix a bogus error when no inline test was declared in a library using
  `(inline_tests)`.
