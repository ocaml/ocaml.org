  ## dune executable

  ### Added

  - Allow running `$ dune exec` in watch mode (with the `-w` flag). In watch mode,
    `$ dune exec` the executed binary whenever it is recompiled. (#6966,
    @gridbugs)

  - Add a `dune cache size` command for displaying the size of the cache (#6638,
    @Alizter)

  - Allow `$ dune ocaml dump-dot-merlin` to run in watch mode. Also this command
    shouldn't print "Entering Directory" mesages. (#6497, @rgrinberg)

  - Add native support for polling mode on Windows (#7010, @yams-yams, @nojb, review by @Rucikir and @jbeckford)

  - Auto-detect `dune-workspace` files as `dune` files in Emacs (#7061,
    @ilankri)

  - Allow `$ dune utop` to load libraries defined in data only directories
    defined using `(subdir ..)` (#6631, @rgrinberg)

  ### Changed

  - Make `dune describe workspace` return consistent dependencies for
    executables and for libraries. By default, compile-time dependencies
    towards PPX-rewriters are from now not taken into account (but
    runtime dependencies always are). Compile-time dependencies towards
    PPX-rewriters can be taken into account by providing the
    `--with-pps` flag. (#6727, fixes #6486, @esope)

  - Use colored output with MDX when Dune colors are enabled. (#6462, @MisterDA)

  - Use colored output with GCC and Clang when compiling C stubs. The
    flag `-fdiagnostics-color=always` is added to the `:standard` set of
    flags. (#4083, @MisterDA)

  - Move `$ dune ocaml-merlin -dump-config=$dir` to `$ dune ocaml merlin
    dump-config $dir`. (#6547, @rgrinberg)

  ### Fixed

  - Fix parsing of OCaml errors that contain code excerpts with `...` in them.
    (#7008, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix `--trace-file` output. Dune now emits a single *complete* event for every
    executed process. Unterminated *async* events are no longer written. (#6892,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Print missing newline after `$ dune exec`. (#6821, fixes #6700, @rgrinberg,
    @Alizter)

  - Fix binary corruption when installing or promoting in parallel (#6669, fixes
    #6668, @edwintorok)

  - Report an error if `dune init ...` would create a "dune" file in a location
    which already contains a "dune" directory (#6705, @gridbugs)

  - Fix the parsing of alerts. They will now show up in diagnostics correctly.
    (#6678, @rginberg)

  - Print "Leaving Directory" whenever "Entering Directory" is printed. (#6419,
    fixes #138, @cpitclaudel, @rgrinberg)

  - Remove "Entering Directory" messages for `$ dune install`. (#6513,
    @rgrinberg)

  - `dune clean` should no longer fail under Windows due to the inability to
    remove the `.lock` file. Also, bring the implementation of the global lock
    under Windows closer to that of Unix. (#6523, @nojb)

  - Fix missing dependencies when detecting the kind of C compiler we're using
    (#6610, fixes #6415, @emillon)

  - Remove spurious build dir created when running `dune init proj ...` (#6707,
    fixes #5429, @gridbugs)

  - Validate the command line arguments for `$ dune ocaml top-module`. This
    command requires one positional argument (#6796, fixes #6793, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix dependency cycle when installing files to the bin section with
    `glob_files` (#6764, fixes #6708, @gridbugs)

  - Handle "Too many links" errors when using Dune cache on Windows (#6993, @nojb)

  - Pre-emptively clear screen in watch mode (#6987, fixes #6884, @rgrinberg)

  - Allow `--sandbox` to affect `ocamldep` invocations. Previously, they were
    wrongly marked as incompatible (#6749, @rgrinberg)

  ## dune language

  ### Added

  - Allow `(include_subdirs qualified)` for OCaml projects. (#6594, fixes #1084,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Format dune files when they are named `dune-file`. This occurs when we enable
    the alternative file names project option. (#6566, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `map_workspace_root` dune-project stanza to allow disabling of
    mapping of workspace root to `/workspace_root`. (#6988, fixes #6929,
    @richardlford)

  - Allow the `cinaps` stanza to set a custom alias. By default, if the alias is
    not set then the cinaps actions will be attached to both `@cinaps` and
    `@runtest` (#6991, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `(using ctypes 0.3)`. When used, paths in `(ctypes)` are interpreted
    relative to where the stanza is defined. (#6883, fixes #5325, @emillon)

  ### Changed

  - Stop passing `-q` flag in `dune coq top`, which allows for `.coqrc` to be
    loaded. (#6848, fixes #6847, @Alizter)

  - Coq native mode is now automatically detected by Dune starting with Coq lang
    0.7. `(mode native)` has been deprecated in favour of detection from the
    configuration of Coq. (#6409, @Alizter)

  - Accurately determine merlin configuration for all sources selected with
    `copy#` and `copy_files#`. The old heuristic of looking for a module in
    parent directories is removed (#6594, @rgrinberg)

  ### Fixed

  - Fix parsing of the `<=` operator in *blang* expressions of `dune` files.
    Previously, the operator would be interpreted as `<`. (#6928, @tatchi)

  - Fix preprocessing with `staged_pps` (#6748, fixes #6644, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix the parsing of decimal and hexadecimal escape literals in `dune`,
    `dune-package`, and other dune s-expression based files (#6710, @shym)

  - Fix cross compilation configuration when a context with targets is itself a
    host of another context (#6958, fixes #6843, @rgrinberg)

  - Allow compilation rules to be impacted by `(env ..)` stanzas that modify the
    environment or set binaries. (#6527, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix handling of support files generated by odoc. (#6913, @jonludlam)

  - Fix the compilation of modules generated at link time when
    `implicit_transitive_deps` is enabled (#6642, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix inline tests with *js_of_ocaml* and whole program compilation mode
    enabled (#6645, @hhugo)

  - Fix *js_of_ocaml* separate compilation rules when `--enable=effects`
    ,`--enable=use-js-string` or `--toplevel` is used. (#6714, #6828, #6920, @hhugo)

  - Fix *js_of_ocaml* separate compilation in presence of linkall (#6832, #6916, @hhugo)

  - `coqdep` is now called once per theory, instead of one time per Coq
    file. This should significantly speed up some builds, as `coqdep`
    startup time is often heavy (#7048, @Alizter, @ejgallego)

The dune team is pleased to announce the release of Dune 3.7.0.

As in [the previous announce](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-6-0/10811), here is a changelog split in several parts: changes to the `dune` executable itself (new commands or options, etc) and changes to the dune language. Most of the changes to the latter are only enabled when you opt-in to the new version by specifying `(lang dune 3.7)` in the corresponding `dune-project` file. In other words, it should always be safe to upgrade the `dune` package.

## ðŸŒŸ Spotlight Features

1. **Watch mode for executables**

  Dune 3.7 now supports watch mode for executables! ðŸŽ‰

  It works just as you'd expect, if you define an executable, you can run it with

  ```sh
  dune exec -w my-executable
  ```

  It will interrupt the process when a file change and re-start the application.

  For a practical example of the workflows enabled by watch-mode, check
  [this demo](https://github.com/tmattio/dune-watchmode-livereload-demo) of a live
  reload for web development:

2. **Native Windows Polling**

  Starting from Dune 3.7, Dune watch mode is now available on Windows!

  [@yams-yams](https://github.com/yams-yams) and [@nojb](https://github.com/nojb)
  from Lexifi have been working on integrating Windows native polling API with
  Dune to supplement the support for `fswatch`, which is unavailable on Windows.

  Windows users can now run `dune build -w` out of the box!

3. **Qualified Subdirs**

  It's quite common to organise your code into subdirectories to separate
  components. Until now, you could do this by including
  `(include_subdirs unqualified)` in your dune files, but this wasn't completely
  satisfying since all of your modules were available in the top-level. If you
  wanted to expose modules in subdirectories under another module, you had to
  create a separate library, which was.. quite the overhead.

  Dune 3.7 brings support for the highly-anticipated qualified sub-directories.
  You can now write `(include_subdirs qualified)` in your dune file, and modules
  in your subdirectories will be exposed under a module with the name of the
  directory.
