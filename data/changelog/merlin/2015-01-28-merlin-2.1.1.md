title: Merlin 2.1.1
date: "2015-01-28"
tags: [merlin, platform]
changelog: |
  + backend:
    - locate: merlin refused to locate things when it had no context (happens
      when the buffer didn't parse for example) claiming it was at the
      "definition point". Fixed.
    - locate: use the cmt path when no ml file was found in the source path
      (this might not be such a good idea, the cases when this work are the ones
      where the user configuration is wrong...)
    - destruct: qualify introduced constructors
    - destruct: eliminate "impossible" GADT branches
    - parser: handle '%' as an operator for 4.00 and 4.01 ( #345 )

  + fake:
    - add typerep support
    - never generate `'_` type variables.

  + vim:
    - show duplicated outlines in CtrlP
    - sort outlines by name length in CtrlP
    - when split method is set to 'tab' *always* open a new tab.
