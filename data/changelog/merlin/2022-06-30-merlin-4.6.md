    - make most library public and split merlin in two packages: the
      `merlin-lib` package that exposes merlin's internals and the `merlin`
      package with the frontend. (#1448, #1455, #1457, #1497, @rgrinberg,
      @tmattio, @kit-ty-kate)
    - Type printing: use best_module_path for paths from Mty_alias (#1470)
    - Attempt at finding the 'real' capitalization of files on windows (#1462 by
      @mlasson)
    - Use newer `Seq`-based API of Yojson 2.0, avoiding the need for the
      deprecated `Stream` module (#1475 by @Leonidas-from-XIV)
    - unify parsing of `MERLIN_LOG` (#1480 by @ulugbekna)
    - Fix type deduplication in `type-enclosing` results (#1483, fixes #1477)

      from dot-merlin-reader (#1486)
    - typing recovery: recover at the granularity of `core_type` (#1484)

    - add method imenu items for emacs (#1481, @mndrix)

      @antalsz)
    - emacs: fix duplicated prefix path in imenu entries (#1495, @bcc32)
