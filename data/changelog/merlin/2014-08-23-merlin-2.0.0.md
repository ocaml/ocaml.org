This is a major release which we worked on for several months, rewriting many
parts of the codebase. An exhaustive list of changes is therefore impossible to
give, but here are some key points (from an user perspective):

- support for OCaml 4.02.{0,1}
- more precise recovery in presence of syntax errors
- more user-friendly messages for syntax errors
- locate now works on MLI files
- automatic reloading of .merlin files (when they are update or created), it
  is no longer necessary to restart merlin
- introduced a small refactoring command: rename, who renames all occurrences
  of an identifier. See: http://yawdp.com/~def/rename.webm


This release also contains contributions from: Yotam Barnoy, Jacques-Pascal
Deplaix, Geoff Gole, Rudi Grinberg, Steve Purcell and Jan Rehders.
