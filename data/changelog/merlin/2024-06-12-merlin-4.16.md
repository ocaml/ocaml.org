title: Merlin 4.16 for OCaml 4.14 and 5.1
tags: [merlin, platform]
changelog: |
  + merlin binary
    - Addition of a `merlin-lib.commands` library which disassociates the
      execution of commands from the `new_protocol`, from the binary, allowing
      it to be invoked from other projects (ocaml/merlin#1758)
    - `merlin-lib.commands`: Add a `find_command_opt` alternative to
      `find_command` that does not raise (ocaml/merlin#1778)

We are pleased to announce the release of Merlin `4.16-414` and `4.16-501`.

These releases expose additional functions for packages using merlin-lib that
need to manually parse merlin commands.
