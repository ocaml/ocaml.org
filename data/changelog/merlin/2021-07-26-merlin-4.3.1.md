changelog: |
  + merlin binary
    - recover ill-typed patterns (#1317, #1342)
    - more accurate type-enclosing for methods (#1328, fixes #1124)
    - fix location of patterns in Occurrences (#1324, fixes ocaml/ocaml-lsp#375)
    - fix location of module definitions done via functors (#1329, fixes #1199)
    - fix -cmt-path dirs mistakenly added to build path (#1330)
    - add new module holes that can replace module expressions (#1333)
    - add a new command `construct` that builds a list of possible terms when
      called on a typed hole (#1318)
    - `refactor-open` improvements (#1313, #1314, #1366, #1372)
      - do not make paths absolute, simply prefix with the identifier under
      the cursor
        ```ocaml
        open Foo (* calling refactor-open qualify on this open *)
        let _ = Foo.bar (* previously could result in [Dune__exe.Foo.bar] *)
        ```
      - do not return identical (duplicate) edits
      - do not return unnecessary edits that when applied do not change
        the document
      - handle record fields properly
      - handle multi-line paths
      - `unqualify` should not qualify
    - Handle `Persistent_env.Error` in `Typemod.initial_env` (#1355)
    - locate: reset global state from all entry points (#1364)
    - Windows: replace user name by its SID in socketnames (#1345, @ttamttam)
  + editor modes
    - vim: add a simple interface to the new `construct` command:
      `MerlinConstruct`. When several results are suggested, `<c-i>`
      and `<c-u>` can be use to change the depth of the recursive
      construction. (#1318)
    - vim: add support for the `merlin-locate-type` command:
      `MerlinLocateType` (#1359)
    - emacs: add a simple interface to the new `construct` command:
      `merlin-construct`. (#1352)
    - emacs: add support for the `merlin-locate-type` command. (#1359)
    - emacs: fix issue with `merlin--highlight` and  various minor improvements
        (#1367, @mattiase)
  + test suite
    - cover the new `construct` command (#1318)
    - disable tests failing in Opam's CI due to nested dune projects (#1373)
