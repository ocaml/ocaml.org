title: Merlin 3.1.0
tags: [merlin, platform]
changelog: |
  + backend
    - new "polarity search" feature: provides a Hoogle-like type-based search
      for libraries that are in merlin's scope.
      See https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/blob/master/doc/features.md#polarity-search
    - new "open refactoring" feature: helps cleaning the code in the scope of an
      open statement.
      See https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/blob/master/doc/features.md#open-refactoring
    - spell-checking: a simple spell-checker has been added to suggest
      corrections when nothing can be directly completed.
    - type-driven record completion: merlin will now make use of type
      information from the context for narrowing and refining completion
      candidates.
    - support for `#require` directive in a source file, and will treat it as a
      package use
    - Add support for OCaml 4.07
    - locate: various minor bugfixes, as well as the following general
      improvements:
      + improved context detection
      + better tracking of namespaces
      + fixed support for local bindings
      + fixed support of disambiguated record fields and variant constructors
      + improved support for functors: merlin will now jump through functor
        application to the functor definitions and in some cases go back to the
        argument that was given (if it is simply reexported).
    - backport fixes of OCaml 4.06.1 to the 4.06 backend
    - various minor bugfixes
