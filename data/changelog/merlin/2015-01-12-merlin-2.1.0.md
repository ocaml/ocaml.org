title: Merlin 2.1.0
date: "2015-01-12"
tags: [merlin, platform]
changelog: |
  + backend:
    - add PPX support
    - make use of context before locating (#308, #316, #318).
    - generate match patterns for arbitrary expressions and missing patterns
      for incomplete matchings (#123).
    - reintroduce type expansion (asking the times of the same expression
      several times will resolve type aliases).
    - "smart" (a.k.a "do what I mean") completion:
          `L.m` will expand to `List.map ; List.m... ; ListLabels.map ; ...` if
          `L` doesn't exist.
    - simplify incremental parser and typer interfaces
    - locate: better handling of packed modules (supposedly)
    - more precise recovery on patterns (before the recovery was done at the
      expression level, so the whole match was discarded, now only the pattern
      is)

  + emacs:
    - don't use fringe in emacs23 (broken)
    - remove obsolete aliases:
        merlin-occurences => merlin-occurrences
        merlin-to-end => merlin-error-check
    - disable merlin-mode on type buffer
    - require caml-types (needed for highlighting) (#331).

  + misc:
    - update README (#301).

  + vim:
    - add a type history buffer (#313, #322) -- only available for vim > 7.3.
    - highlight types when displaying them in the command line -- only for vim >
      7.3
    - add tab completion for the argument of the `:Locate` command
    - add support for text objects based on type enclosing
    - introduce an interactive version of `:Rename`
    - locate results can now be shown in a new or existing tab (#335)
    - use `fileencoding` where necessary (#332)
    - ctrlp bindings for outline and locate
