title: Merlin 1-4
date: "2013-09-25"
tags: [merlin, platform]
changelog: |
  + backend:
    - lazy processing of open directives makes merlin much faster
    - simplified buffer management
    - tweak signal handling to improve windows compatibility
    - track verbosity of query: repeated queries are considered more "verbose"
    - type expansion: expand type aliases for verbose query
    - add support for OUnit-like Benchmark extension
    - more tolerant type checker, to provide completion on ill-typed
      expressions
    - proper version reporting with git revision
    - refactored logging subsystem
    - add support "val constructs" in implementation: report errors but add
      definition to current environment
    - add FLG, EXT and PRJ in .merlin
    - "locate" command now works in much more situations
    - one distribution for 4.00 and 4.01, introduced common interface between
      both, typers now live in https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin-typers
    - new implementation of the main merlin state tracking ast & types
    - better error reporting thanks to a contribution from Ronan Lehy

  + documentation:
    - started a wiki (https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin/wiki)
    - wrote 'from-scratch' guides to ease setting-up merlin in your editor

  + emacs
    - during completion with auto-complete, you can hit C-c C-l on a candidate
      to jump on its definition
    - made communication with merlin asynchronous (using transfer queues) hence
      improving responsiveness
    - when running a merlin command, the errors present in all phrases but the
      current one are displayed
    - fixed buffer cleaning
    - successive call to C-c C-t do not climb the typed tree but improve merlin's
      verbosity. To move inside the tree use C-down and C-up (which implements
      phrase movement if there is no enclosing started).
    - customize data for merlin
    - refactoring and numerous bugfixes
