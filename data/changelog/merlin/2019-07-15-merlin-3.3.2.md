    - `**` globbing in .merlin won't look into hidden directories
      (starting with a '.') (by Daniel BÃ¼nzli, #990)
    - fallback to "/dev/null" configuration for findlib

      + support for letop (let+, and+, ...) (#986)
      + fix parsing recovery for 4.08 constructions (#987)
      + catch an exception raised by 4.08 Printtyp trying to rename a
        persistent identifier (#991)
