    - `**` globbing in .merlin won't look into hidden directories
      (starting with a '.') (by Daniel Bünzli, #990)
    - fallback to "/dev/null" configuration for findlib
    - better 4.08 support:
      + support for letop (let+, and+, ...) (#986)
      + fix parsing recovery for 4.08 constructions (#987)
      + catch an exception raised by 4.08 Printtyp trying to rename a
        persistent identifier (#991)
    - locate: treat local locations differently from external locations (coming

      bindings (#984)
    - when completing an infix operator in a sub-module, wrap with () (#992)
    - disable arity checks on externals (for Bucklescript compatibility)

  + editor modes
    - emacs
      + fix position computation in presence of tabs or multi-byte characters (#981)
      + log arguments in "merlin-debug-last-commands" (#981)
