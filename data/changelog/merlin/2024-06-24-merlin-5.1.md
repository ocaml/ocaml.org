tags: [merlin, platform]
changelog: |
  + merlin binary
    - Support project-wide occurrences queries using index files (ocaml/merlin#1766)
      - The file format is described in library `Merlin_lib.index_format`
      - Two new configuration directives are introduced:
        - `SOURCE_ROOT` that is used to resolve relative paths found in the
          indexes.
        - `INDEX` that is used to declare the list of index files Merlin should
          use when looking for occurrences.
    - A new `UNIT_NAME` configuration directive that can be used to tell Merlin
      the correct name of the current unit in the presence of wrapping (ocaml/merlin#1776)
    - Perform incremental indexation of the buffer when typing. (ocaml/merlin#1777)
    - `merlin-lib.commands`: Add a `find_command_opt` alternative to
      `find_command` that does not raise (ocaml/merlin#1778)
    - Prevent uid clashes by not returning PWO for defs located in the current
      interface file (ocaml/merlin#1781)
    - Reset uid counters when restoring the typer cache so that uids are stable
      across re-typing (ocaml/merlin#1779)
    - Improve the behavior on occurrences when the cursor is on a label /
      constructor declaration (ocaml/merlin#1785)

    - emacs: add basic support for project-wide occurrences (ocaml/merlin#1766)

new feature: project-wide occurrences queries.

Try it by running `dune build @ocaml-index` (since dune `3.16.0`) and performing a reference query!
