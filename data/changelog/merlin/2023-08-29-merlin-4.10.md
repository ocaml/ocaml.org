changelog: |
  + merlin binary
    - Constrain socket path buffer size to avoid build warnings (#1631)
    - Handle concurrent server start (#1622)
    - Omit module prefixes for constructors and record fields in the
      `construct` command (#1618).  Prefixes are still produced when
      warning 42 (disambiguated name) is active.
    - Correctly invalidate PPX cache when pipeline ran partially (#1650,
      fixes #1647)
    - Prevent `short-path` from looping in some cases related to recursive type
      definitions (#1645)
    - Support parsing negative numbers in sexps (#1655)
    - Fix construct not working with inline records (#1658)
    - Improve behavior of `type-enclosing` on let/and operators (#1653)
    - Fix occurrences of extension constructors (#1662)
    - Improve node selection when ghosts are present (#1664, fixes #1660)
  + editor modes
    - emacs: call merlin-client-logger with "interrupted" if the
      merlin binary itself is interrupted, not just the parsing of the
      result (#1626).
    - emacs: merlin-construct, with a prefix argument, now includes
      local values in the completion options.  Alternatively, this
      behavior can be enabled permanently by customizing
      `merlin-construct-with-local-values` (#1644)
    - emacs: add support for opam-switch-mode (#1654, fixes #1591).

We're thrilled to announce the release of Merlin 4.10, which comes with many bug
fixes and improvements.

One of the standout features of this release is the significantly enhanced
support for binding operators like `let+` and `and+`. You'll find that the
results from `type-enclosing` on expressions that contain let bindings are now
more precise.
