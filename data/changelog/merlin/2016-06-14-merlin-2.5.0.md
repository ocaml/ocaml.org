title: Merlin 2.5.0
tags: [merlin, platform]
changelog: |
  + frontend:
    - now all commands can take a context, this reduce the amount of state
      in the command interpreter. Long term goal is to make protocol stateless
    - merlin now supports customizable "readers": processes responsible for
      parsing and pretty-printing. Main use-case is Reason, cppo/optcomp support
      might be added later
  + backend:
    - drop support for 4.00 / 4.01
    - support for 4.03 has been added
    - new implementation of type recovery, should diverge less from upstream
    - support for 4.02 was reimplemented to use the same design
    - menhir's fork has been synchronized with upstream, recovery algorithm
      is completely new
  + vim: add support for python3, update to new protocol
  + emacs: update to new protocol, bug fixes
