title: Merlin 2.2
date: "2015-06-10"
tags: [merlin, platform]
changelog: |
  + backend:
    - completion
        + return the type of the expected argument when completing an
          application.
          This allows us to offer completion for named and optional parameters,
          as well as polymorphic variants
        + optionally associates ocamldoc comments to candidates
        + adds field completion inside records ( #296 )
    - locate:
        + partially rewritten, introduces a new kind of cache
          (so potentially noticeably bigger memory consumption)
        + better handling of functors
        + handle local modules
        + fix occasional "inconsistent assumptions"
    - error reporting:
        + handle environment errors (inconsistent assumptions, â€¦)
        + filter duplicated messages
        + fix type error reporting:
            "this expression has type t = t but an expression was expected of
            type u = u"
          we now only print the equality when it adds some information
        + less noisy pattern recovery: when every pattern is recovered, consider
          that the matched expression is the the source of the problem, and
          retry typing with "'a" as the type of the matched expression.
    - add support for trunk
    - add a "document" command: takes an ident and return its documentation (if
      any)
    - destruct: use more precise environments ( #389 )
    - warnings:
        + check signature inclusion to prevent spurious warnings about unused
          declarations
        + backport 4.02-style warning management
        + add a dump command
    - nonrec: update implementation to more-or-less match the upstream one
      (upstream >= 4.02.2)
    - parser: improve marking heuristic in presence of ;; or toplevel
      directives.
    - typeof: during verbose expansion, also print the type declaration if we
      have a type constructor

  + emacs:
    - fix bindings of every completion backend
    - bind ocamldoc comments to company (optional)
    - detect race conditions when running synchronous commands
    - cleanup "merlin-process-started-p"
    - locate error messages were silently ignored, they are now printed
    - drop text properties from commands sent to merlin (pull request #383 by
      milanst)
    - Tell merlin the content of the buffer when opening a new buffer.
      This allows merlin idle-job to preload content if nothing else is
      requested.
    - remove call to merlin from the lighter

  + vim:
    - fix ctrlp binding for locate
    - add (dwim) completion on :TypeOf
    - while completing, candidates documentation can be displayed in the
      "preview" window
    - prefix every command name by "Merlin" ( #379 )
    - Tell merlin the content of the buffer when opening a new buffer.
      This allows merlin idle-job to preload content if nothing else is
      requested.
