  + backend:
    - better handling of paths (both sources and build)

      [val _here_ : Lexing.position])
    - added support for [assert_lwt]
    - fixed typing of [while_lwt]

  + vim:
    - vim plugin can be installed into a custom directory and has its own
      makefile target (contribution from Vsevolod Velichko)
