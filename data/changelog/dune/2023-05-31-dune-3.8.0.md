  ## Added

  - Introduce mdx stanza 0.4 requiring mdx >= 2.3.0 which updates the default
    list of files to include `*.mld` files (#7582, @Leonidas-from-XIV)

  - Allow `(stdlib ...)` to be used with `(wrapped false)` in library stanzas
    (#7139, @anmonteiro).

  - Allow the main module of a library with `(stdlib ...)` to depend on other
    libraries (#7154, @anmonteiro).

  - Support `(link_flags ...)` in `(cinaps ...)` stanza. (#7423, fixes #7416,
    @nojb)

  - Allow `(package ...)` in any position within `(rule ...)` stanza (#7445,
    @Leonidas-from-XIV)

  - Added a new user action `(concurrent )` which is like `(progn )` but runs the
    actions concurrently. (#6933, @Alizter)

  - Accept the Ordered Set Language for the `modes` field in `library` stanzas
    (#6611, @anmonteiro).

  - Allow parallel execution of inline tests partitions (#7012, @hhugo)

  - Add the `--display-separate-messages` flag to separate the error messages
    produced by commands with a blank line. (#6823, fixes #6158, @esope)

  - Add `--watch-exclusions` to Dune build options (#7216, @jonahbeckford)

  - Adds support for loading plugins in toplevels (#6082, fixes #6081,
    @ivg, @richardlford)

  - Introduce a `public_headers` field on libraries. This field is like
    `install_c_headers`, but it allows to choose the extension and choose the
    paths for the installed headers. (#7512, @rgrinberg)

  - Dune can now detect Coq theories from outside the workspace. This allows for
    composition with installed theories (not necessarily installed with Dune).
    (#7047, @Alizter, @ejgallego)

  - Added a `--no-build` option to `dune coq top` for avoiding rebuilds (#7380,
    fixes #7355, @Alizter)

  - Add a `coqdoc_flags` field to the `coq.theory` stanza allowing the user to
    pass extra arguments to `coqdoc`. (#7676, fixes #7954 @Alizter)

  - Preliminary support for Coq compiled intefaces (`.vos` files) enabled via
    `(mode vos)` in `coq.theory` stanzas. This can be used in combination with
    `dune coq top` to obtain fast re-building of dependencies (with no checking
    of proofs) prior to stepping into a file. (#7406, @rlepigre)

  - Read `pkg-config` arguments from the `PKG_CONFIG_ARGN` environment variable
    (#1492, #7734, @anmonteiro)

  - Use `$PKG_CONFIG`, when set, to find the `pkg-config` binary  (#7469, fixes
    #2572, @anmonteiro)

  ## Changed

  - Bootstrap: remove reliance on shell. Previously, we'd use the shell to get
    the number of processors. (#7274, @rgrinberg)

  - Non-user proccesses such as version control or config checking are now run
    silently. (#6994, fixes #4066, @Alizter)

  - Bytecode executables built for JSOO are linked with `-noautolink` and no
    longer depend on the shared stubs of their dependent libraries (#7156, @nojb)

  - Always include `opam` files in the generated `.install` file. Previously, it
    would not be included whenever `(generate_opam_files true)` was set and the
    `.install` file wasn't yet generated. (#7547, @rgrinberg)

  ## Deprecated

  - Modules that were declared in `(modules_without_implementation)`,
    `(private_modules)` or `(virtual_modules)` but not declared in `(modules)`
    will cause Dune to emit a warning which will become an error in 3.9. (#7608,
    fixes #7026, @Alizter)

  - Coq language versions less 0.8 are deprecated, and will be removed
    in an upcoming Dune version. All users are required to migrate to
    `(coq lang 0.8)` which provides the right semantics for theories
    that have been globally installed, such as those coming from opam
    (@ejgallego, @Alizter)

  ## Fixed

  - Find `pps` dependencies in the host context when cross-compiling,  (#7415,
    fixes #4156, @anmonteiro)

  - Fix plugin loading with findlib. The functionality was broken in 3.7.0.
    (#7556, @anmonteiro)

  - Load the host context `findlib.conf` when cross-compiling (#7428, fixes
    #1701, @rgrinberg, @anmonteiro)

  - Allow overriding the `ocaml` binary with findlib configuration (#7648,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Resolve `ppx_runtime_libraries` in the target context when cross compiling
    (#7450, fixes #2794, @anmonteiro)

  - Fix `dune install` when cross compiling (#7410, fixes #6191, @anmonteiro,
    @rizo)

  - Fix string quoting in the json file written by `--trace-file` (#7773,
    @rleshchinskiy)

  - Correctly set `MANPATH` in `dune exec`. Previously, we would use the `bin/`
    directory of the context. (#7655, @rgrinberg)

  - merlin: ignore instrumentation settings for preprocessing. (#7606, fixes
    #7465, @Alizter)

  - When a rule's action is interrupted, delete any leftover directory targets.
    This is consistent with how we treat file targets. (#7564, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix dune crashing on MacOS in watch mode whenever `$PATH` contains `$PWD`
    (#7441, fixes #6907, @rgrinberg)

  - Dune in watch mode no longer builds concurrent rules in serial (#7395
    @rgrinberg, @jchavarri)

  - `dune coq top` now correctly respects the project root when called from a
    subdirectory. However, absolute filenames passed to `dune coq top` are no
    longer supported (due to being buggy) (#7357, fixes #7344, @rlepigre and
    @Alizter)

  - RPC: Ignore SIGPIPE when clients suddenly disconnect (#7299, #7319, fixes
    #6879, @rgrinberg)

  - Always clean up the UI on exit. (#7271, fixes #7142 @rgrinberg)

  - Bootstrap: correctly detect the number of processors by allowing `nproc` to be
    looked up in `$PATH` (#7272, @Alizter)

  - Speed up file copying on macos by using `clonefile` when available
    (@rgrinberg, #7210)

  - Support commands that output 8-bit and 24-bit colors in the terminal (#7188,
    @Alizter)

  - Speed up rule generation for libraries and executables with many modules
    (#7187, @jchavarri)

  - Do not re-render UI on every frame if the UI doesn't change (#7186, fix
    #7184, @rgrinberg)

  - Make `coq_db` creation in scope lazy (@ejgallego, #7133)

  - dune install now respects --display quiet mode (#7116, fixes #4573, fixes
    #7106, @Alizter)

  - Stub shared libraries (`dllXXX_stubs.so`) in Dune-installed libraries could
    not be used as dependencies of libraries in the workspace (eg when compiling
    to bytecode and/or Javascript).  This is now fixed. (#7151, @nojb)

  - Fix regression where Merlin was unable to handle filenames with uppercase
    letters under Windows. (#7577, @nojb)

  - On nix+macos, pass `-f` to the codesign hook to avoid errors when the binary
    is already signed (#7183, fixes #6265, @greedy)

  - Fix bug where RPC clients built with dune-rpc-lwt would crash when closing
    their connection to the server (#7581, @gridbugs)

  - Fix RPC server on Windows (used for OCaml-LSP). (#7666, @nojb)

The dune team is pleased to announce the release of Dune 3.8.0.

It is now available in `opam-repository`. As usual, it should always be safe to upgrade your `dune` package: new features and deprecations are only available if you upgrade the language version in your `dune-project` files.

## 🌟 Spotlight Features

1. **Dune `concurrent` action**

  Dune 3.8.0 introduced the new `concurrent` action. You can now use it instead of the `progn` action to execute actions concurrently.

  For instance:

  ```
  (rule
  (action
    (concurrent
    (write-file A "I am file A.\n")
    (write-file B "I am certainly file B.\n")
    (write-file C "I am most certainly file C.\n"))))
  ```

  will write to files `A`, `B` and `C` concurrently.

2. **Support for `.mld` files**

  In Dune 3.7.0, we introduced version `0.3` of the `mdx` stanza, which came with support for `.mld` files.

  In Dune 3.8.0, `.mld` files are now supported by default with version `0.4` of the `mdx` stanza!

  Have a look at [this diff](https://github.com/tmattio/demo-mdx-mld/compare/dune-3-8-0) to see how to migrate your code to the new stanza version.
