It's quite common to organise your code into subdirectories to separate
components. Until now, you could do this by including
`(include_subdirs unqualified)` in your dune files, but this wasn't completely
satisfying since all of your modules were available in the top-level. If you
wanted to expose modules in subdirectories under another module, you had to
create a separate library, which was.. quite the overhead.

Dune 3.7 brings support for the highly-anticipated qualified sub-directories.
You can now write `(include_subdirs qualified)` in your dune file, and modules
in your subdirectories will be exposed under a module with the name of the
directory.
