title: Dune 3.8.1
date: "2023-06-06"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  * Fix a crash when using a version of Coq < 8.13 due to the native compiler
    config variable being missing. We now explicitly default to `(mode vo)` for
    these older versions of Coq. ([dune#7847](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7847), fixes [dune#7846](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/7846), @Alizter)
  * Duplicate installed Coq theories are now allowed with the first appearing in
    COQPATH being preferred. This is inline with Coq's loadpath semantics. This
    fixes an issue with install layouts based on COQPATH such as those found in
    nixpkgs. ([dune#7790](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7790), @Alizter)
  * Revert [dune#7415](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7415) and [dune#7450](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7450) (Resolve `ppx_runtime_libraries` in the target context when
    cross compiling) ([dune#7887](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7887), fixes [dune#7875](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/7875), @emillon)

We've just released a patch version of Dune to fix regressions introduced in Dune 3.8.0.

In particular, we've reverted some cross-compilation improvements that caused build failures when using `ppx_runtime_libraries` and we'll revisit them in a future version of Dune.
