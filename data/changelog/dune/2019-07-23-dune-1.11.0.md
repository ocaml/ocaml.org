title: Dune 1.11.0
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Don't select all local implementations in `dune utop`. Instead, let the
    default implementation selection do its job. (#2327, fixes #2323, @TheLortex,
    review by @rgrinberg)

  - Check that selected implementations (either by variants or default
    implementations) are indeed implementations. (#2328, @TheLortex, review by
    @rgrinberg)

  - Don't reserve the `Ppx` toplevel module name for ppx rewriters (#2242, @jeremiedimino)

  - Redesign of the library variant feature according to the #2134 proposal. The
    set of variants is now computed when the virtual library is installed.
    Introducing a new `external_variant` stanza. (#2169, fixes #2134, @TheLortex,
    review by @jeremiedimino)

  - Add proper line directives when copying `.cc` and `.cxx` sources (#2275,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Fix error message for missing C++ sources. The `.cc` extension was always
    ignored before. (#2275, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `$ dune init project` subcommand to create project boilerplate according
    to a common template. (#2185, fixes #159, @shonfeder)

  - Allow to run inline tests in javascript with nodejs (#2266, @hhugo)

  - Build `ppx.exe` as compiling host binary. (#2286, fixes #2252, @toots, review
    by @rgrinberg and @jeremiedimino)

  - Add a `cinaps` extension and stanza for better integration with the
    [cinaps tool](https://github.com/janestreet/cinaps) tool (#2269,
    @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow to embed build info in executables such as version and list
    and version of statically linked libraries (#2224, @jeremiedimino)

  - Set version in `META` and `dune-package` files to the one read from
    the vcs when no other version is available (#2224, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add a variable `%{target}` to be used in situations where the context
    requires at most one word, so `%{targets}` can be confusing; stdout
    redirections and "-o" arguments of various tools are the main use
    case; also, introduce a separate field `target` that must be used
    instead of `targets` in those situations.  (#2341, @aalekseyev)

  - Fix dependency graph of wrapped_compat modules. Previously, the dependency on
    the user written entry module was omitted. (#2305, @rgrinberg)

  - Allow to promote executables built with an `executable` stanza
    (#2379, @jeremiedimino)

  - When instantiating an implementation with a variant, make sure it matches
    virtual library's list of known implementations. (#2361, fixes #2322,
    @TheLortex, review by @rgrinberg)

  - Add a variable `%{ignoring_promoted_rules}` that is `true` when
    `--ingore-promoted-rules` is passed on the command line and false
    otherwise (#2382, @jeremiedimino)

  - Fix a bug in `future_syntax` where the characters `@` and `&` were
    not distinguished in the names of binding operators (`let@` was the
    same as `let&`) (#2376, @aalekseyev, @jeremiedimino)

  - Workspaces with non unique project names are now supported. (#2377, fix #2325,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Improve opam generation to include the `dune` dependencies with the minimum
    constraint set based on the dune language version specified in the
    `dune-project` file. (2383, @avsm)

  - The order of fields in the generated opam file now follows order preferred in
    opam-lib. (@avsm, #2380)

  - Fix coloring of error messages from the compiler (@jeremiedimino, #2384)

  - Add warning `66` to default set of warnings starting for dune projects with
    language verison >= `1.11` (@rgrinberg, @jeremiedimino, fixes #2299)

  - Add (dialect ...) stanza
    (@nojb, #2404)

  - Add a `--context` argument to `dune install/uninstall` (@jeremiedimino, #2412)

  - Do not warn about merlin files pre 1.9. This warning can only be disabled in
    1.9 (#2421, fixes #2399, @emillon)

  - Add a new `inline_tests` field in the env stanza to control inline_tests
    framework with a variable (#2313, @mlasson, original idea by @jeremiedimino, review
    by @rgrinberg).

  - New binary kind `js` for executables in order to explicitly enable Javascript
    targets, and a switch `(explicit_js_mode)` to require this mode in order to
    declare JS targets corresponding to executables. (#1941, @nojb)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the release of dune 1.11.0. This release contains quite a few new interesting features such as custom dialects: anyone can define their own OCaml based syntax. Is anyone up to revive the revised syntax? :slight_smile: I'd also like to highlight the the re-launch of variants feature in a sounder form, a new `build-info` library that queries build information, and that `dune init` can initialize an entire project. But of course, by far the most important thing is that the compiler's colours are now back :champagne:
