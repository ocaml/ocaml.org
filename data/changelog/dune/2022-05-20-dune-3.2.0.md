title: Dune 3.2.0
date: "2022-05-20"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Fixed ``dune describe workspace --with-deps`` so that it correctly
    handles Reason files, as well as files any other dialect. (#5701, @esope)

  - Disable alerts when compiling code in vendored directories (#5683,
    @NathanReb)

  - Fixed ``dune describe --with-deps``, that crashed when some
    preprocessing was required in a dune file using ``per_module``.
    (#5682, fixes #5680, @esope)

  - Add `$ dune describe pp` to print the preprocssed ast of sources. (#5615,
    fixes #4470, @cannorin)

  - Report dune file evaluation errors concurrently. In the same way we report
    build errors. (#5655, @rgrinberg)

  - Watch mode now default to clearing the terminal on rebuild (#5636, fixes,
    #5216, @rgrinberg)

  - The output of jobs that finished but were cancelled is now omitted. (#5631,
    fixes #5482, @rgrinberg)

  - Allows to configure all the default destination directories with `./configure`
    (adds `bin`, `sbin`, `data`, `libexec`). Use `OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX` instead of
    calling the `opam` binaries in `dune install`. Fix handling of multiple
    `libdir` in `./configure` for handling `/usr/lib/ocaml/` and
    `/usr/local/lib/ocaml`. In `dune install` forbid relative directories in
    `libdir`, `docdir` and others specific directory setting because their handling
    was inconsistent (#5516, fixes #3978 and #5455, @bobot)

  - `--terminal-persistence=clear-on-rebuild` will no longer destroy scrollback
    on some terminals (#5646, @rgrinberg)

  - Add a fmt command as a shortcut of `dune build @fmt --auto-promote` (#5574,
    @tmattio)

  - Watch mode now tracks copied external files, external directories for
    dependencies, dune files in OCaml syntax, files used by `include` stanzas,
    dune-project, opam files, libraries builtin with compiler, and foreign
    sources (#5627, #5645, #5652, #5656, #5672, #5691, #5722, fixes #5331,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Improve metrics for cram tests. Include test names in the event and add a
    category for cram tests (#5626, @rgrinberg)

  - Allow specifying multiple licenses in project file (#5579, fixes #5574,
    @liyishuai)

  - Match `glob_files` only against files in external directories (#5614, fixes
    #5540, @rgrinberg)

  - Add pid's to chrome trace output (#5617, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix race when creating local cache directory (#5613, fixes #5461, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `not` to boolean expressions (#5610, fix #5503, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix relative dependencies outside the workspace (#4035, fixes #5572, @bobot)

  - Allow to specify `--prefix` via the environment variable
    `DUNE_INSTALL_PREFIX` (#5589, @vapourismo)

  - Dune-site.plugin: add support for `archive(native|byte, plugin)` used in the
    wild before findlib documented `plugin(native|byte)` in 2015 (#5518, @bobot)

  - Fix a bug where Dune would not correctly interpret `META` files in alternative
    layout (ie when the META file is named `META.$pkg`). The `Llvm` bindings were
    affected by this issue. (#5619, fixes #5616, @nojb)

  - Support `(binaries)` in `(env)` in dune-workspace files (#5560, fix #5555,
    @emillon)

  - (mdx) stanza: add support for (locks). (#5628, fixes #5489, @emillon)

  - (mdx) stanza: support including files in different directories using relative
    paths, and provide better error messages when paths are invalid (#5703, #5704,
    fixes #5596, @emillon)

  - Fix ctypes rules for external lib names which aren't valid ocaml names
    (#5667, fixes #5511, @Khady)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the availability of version 3.2.0. This release contains few new features, but is packed with bug fixes and usability improvements. In particular, I'd like to point out that we've continued to improve the user experience with the watch mode. I encourage you all to try it out if you haven't already.

Happy Hacking.
