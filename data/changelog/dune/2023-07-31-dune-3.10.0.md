We're happy to announce the release of Dune 3.10.0. It comes with some internal
fixes as well as some interesting features:

- some changes in `dune describe` that will allow a better implementation of
  [opam-dune-lint](https://github.com/ocurrent/opam-dune-lint) to check the
  consistency between library and package dependencies
- more commands made available under `dune show` for a more consistent command
  line interface
