The dune team is pleased to announce the 1.4.0 release of Dune. The highlight of this release is the improved support for menhir, in particular the long awaited `--infer` flag. This seemingly small feature took quite a bit of coordination between the maintainers of dune and menhir. So I'd like to thank @fpottier for helping us out with this by adding better support for dune in menhir itself, and implementing the majority of the support in dune as well.

The rest of the release is mostly bug fixes, but one notable feature is that dune is now `C-c` friendly. Dune will now resume exactly where it's stopped after interruption instead of restarting the entire build.

EDIT: I actually forgot to mention that this release also includes [integration with ocamlformat](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formatting.html - [404 Not Found]) due to @emillon. Initially, I had thought that this feature was released in 1.3.0. Sorry about that!
