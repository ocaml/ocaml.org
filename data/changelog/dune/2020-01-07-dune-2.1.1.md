title: Dune 2.1.1
date: "2020-01-07"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Attach cinaps stanza actions to both `@runtest` and `@cinaps` aliases
    (#2831, @NathanReb)

  - Add variables `%{lib-private...}` and `%{libexec-private...}` for finding
    build paths of files in public and private libraries within the same
    project. (#2901, @snowleopard)

  - Add `--mandir` option to `$ dune install`. This option allows to override the
    installation directory for man pages. (#2915, fixes #2670, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix `dune --version`. The bootstrap didn't compute the version
    correctly. (#2929, fixes #2911, @diml)

  - Do not open the log file in `dune clean`. (#2965, fixes #2964 and
    #2921, @diml)

  - Support passing two arguments to `=`, `<>`, ... operators in package
    dependencies so that we can have things such as `(<> :os win32)`
    (#2965, @diml)

  - Guess foreign archives & native archives for libraries defined using the
    `META` format. (#2994, @rgrinberg, @anmonteiro)

  - Fix generation of `.merlin` files when depending on local libraries with more
    than one source directory. (#2983, @rgrinberg)
