title: Dune 1.1.0
date: "2018-08-06"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Fix lookup of command line specified files when `--root` is given. Previously,
    passing in `--root` in conjunction with `--workspace` or `--config` would not
    work correctly (#997, @rgrinberg)

  - Add support for customizing env nodes in workspace files. The `env` stanza is
    now allowed in toplevel position in the workspace file, or for individual
    contexts. This feature requires `(dune lang 1.1)` (#1038, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `enabled_if` field for aliases and tests. This field controls whether the
    test will be ran using a boolean expression language. (#819, @rgrinberg)

  - Make `name`, `names` fields optional when a `public_name`, `public_names`
    field is provided. (#1041, fix #1000, @rgrinberg)

  - Interpret `X` in `--libdir X` as relative to `PREFIX` when `X` is relative
    (#1072, fix #1070, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add support for multi directory libraries by writing
    `(include_subdirs unqualified)` (#1034, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add `(staged_pps ...)` to support staged ppx rewriters such as ones
    using the OCaml typer like `ppx_import` (#1080, fix #193, @jeremiedimino)

  - Use `-opaque` in the `dev` profile. This option trades off binary quality for
    compilation speed when compiling .cmx files. (#1079, fix #1058, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix placeholders in `dune subst` documentation (#1090, @emillon, thanks
    @trefis for the bug report)

  - Add locations to errors when a missing binary in PATH comes from a dune file
    (#1096, fixes #1095, @rgrinberg)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm proud to announce the 1.1.0 release of dune. This release contains a few interesting features that I won't describe in this post, because I've already written a dedicated blog post about this release: http://rgrinberg.com/posts/dune-upcoming-1-1/
