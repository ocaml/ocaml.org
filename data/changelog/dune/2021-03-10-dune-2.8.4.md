changelog: |
  - Make `patdiff` show refined diffs (#4257, fixes #4254, @hakuch)

  - Fixed a bug that could result in needless recompilation under Windows due to
    case differences in the result of `Sys.getcwd` (observed under `emacs`).
    (#3966, @nojb).

  - Restore compatibility with Coq < 8.10 for coq-lang < 0.3 , document
    that `(using coq 0.3)` does require Coq 8.10 at least (#4224, fixes
    #4142, @ejgallego)

  - Add a META rule for `compiler-libs.native-toplevel` (#4175, @altgr)

    `merlin` (#4211, fixes #4188, @nojb)

    bytecode (#4200, @nojb)
