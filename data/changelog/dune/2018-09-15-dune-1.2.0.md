changelog: |
  - Ignore stderr output when trying to find out the number of jobs
    available (#1118, fix #1116, @jeremiedimino)

    (#1120, fix #1099, @emillon)

  - Highlight error locations in error messages (#1121, @emillon)

  - Display actual stanza when package is ambiguous (#1126, fix #1123, @emillon)

    #1149, @emillon)

  - Do no try to generate shared libraries when this is not supported by
    the OS (#1165, fix #1051, @jeremiedimino)

  - Fix `Flags.write_{sexp,lines}` in configurator by avoiding the use of
    `Stdune.Path` (#1175, fix #1161, @rgrinberg)

  - Add support for `findlib.dynload`: when linking an executable using
    `findlib.dynload`, automatically record linked in libraries and
    findlib predicates (#1172, @bobot)

  - Add `(env var)` to add a dependency to an environment variable.
    (#1186, @emillon)

  - Add a simple version of a polling mode: `dune build -w` keeps
    running and restarts the build when something change on the
    filesystem (#1140, @kodek16)

  - Cleanup the way we detect the library search path. We no longer call
    `opam config var lib` in the default build context (#1226, @jeremiedimino)

  - Make test stanzas honor the -p flag. (#1236, fix #1231, @emillon)

  - Test stanzas take an optional (action) field to customize how they run (#1248,
    #1195, @emillon)

  - Add support for private modules via the `private_modules` field (#1241, fix
    #427, @rgrinberg)

    response file when the list of arguments is too long (#1256, @jeremiedimino)

  - Do not print diffs by default when running inside dune (#1260, @jeremiedimino)

    @rgrinberg)

    #1264, @rgrinberg)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the release of Dune 1.2.0. This release contains many new goodies which I will not describe here. This is because Etienne Millon has prepared a blog post for this release: https://tarides.com/2018-09-06-dune-1-2-0.html

I'd also like to personally thank him for all work he's done to make this release so great.

As usual, the change log is replicated below for your convenience.

Happy hacking!
