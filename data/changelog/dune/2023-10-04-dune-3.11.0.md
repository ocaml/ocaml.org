title: Dune 3.11.0
date: "2023-10-04"
tags: [dune, platform, release]
changelog: |

  ## Added

  - `enabled_if` now supports `arch_sixtyfour` variable (#8023, fixes #7997,
    @Alizter)

  - Experimental: Added a `$ dune monitor` command that can connect to a running
    `dune build` in watch mode and display the errors and progress. (#8152,
    @Alizter)

  - The `progress` RPC procedure now has an extra field for the `In_progress`
    constructor for the number of failed jobs. (#8212, @Alizter)

  - Add a `--preview` flag to `dune fmt` which causes it to print out the changes
    it would make without applying them (#8289, @gridbugs)

  - Introduce `(source_trees ..)` to the install stanza to allow installing
    entire source trees. (#8349, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `--stop-on-first-error` option to `dune build` which will terminate the
    build when the first error is encountered. (#8400, @pmwhite and @Alizter)

  - Dune now displays the number of errors when waiting for changes in watch
    mode. (#8408, fixes #6889, @Alizter)

  - Add `with_prefix` keyword for changing the prefix of the destination of
    installed files matched by globs. (#8416, @gridbugs)

  - Added experimental `--display tui` option for Dune that opens an interactive
    Terminal User Interface (TUI) when Dune is running. Press '?' to open up a
    help screen when running for more information. (#8429, @Alizter and
    @rgrinberg) 

  - Add a `warnings` field to `dune-project` files as a unified mechanism to
    enable or disable dune warnings (@rgrinberg, 8448)

  - `dune exec`: support syntax like `%{bin:program}`. This can appear anywhere
    in the command line, so things like `dune exec time %{bin:program}` now work.
    (#6035, #8474, fixes #2691, @emillon, @Leonidas-from-XIV)

  - Add a new alias `@doc-json` to build odoc documentation in JSON format. This
    output can be consumed by external tools. (#8178, @emillon)

  ## Changed and Fixed

  - Use `posix_spawn` instead of `fork` on MacOS. This gives us a performance
    boost and allows us to re-enable thread. (#8090, @rgrinberg)

  - Modules that were declared in `(modules_without_implementation)`,
    `(private_modules)` or `(virtual_modules)` but not declared in `(modules)`
    will raise an error. (#7674, @Alizter)

  - No longer emit linkopts(javascript) in META files (#8168, @hhugo)

  - RPC message styles are now serialised meaning that RPC diagnostics keep their
    ANSI styling. (#8516, fixes #6921, @Alizter)

  - Truncate output from actions that produce too much output (@tov, #8351)

  - Allow libraries to shadow OCaml built-in libraries. Previously, built-in
    libraries would always take precedence. (@rgrinberg, #8558)

  - `dune utop` no longer links `utop` in "custom" mode, which should make this
    command considerably faster. (#8631, fixes #6894, @nojb)

  - Ensure that package names in `dune-project` are valid opam package names.
    (#8331, @emillon)

  - init: check that module names are valid (#8644, fixes #8252, @emillon)

  - dune init: parse `--public` as a public name (#8603, fixes #7108, @emillon)

  - Stop signing source files with substitutions. Sign only binaries instead
    (#8361, fixes #8360, @anmonteiro)

  - Make copy sandbox support directory targets. (#8705, fixes #7724, @emillon)

  ## Deprecated and Removed

  - Deprecate install destination paths beginning with ".." to prevent packages
    escaping their designated installation directories. (#8350, @gridbugs)

  - Remove warning against `.dune` files generated by pre Dune 2.0 (#8611,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Remove versions 0.1 and 0.2 of the experimental ctypes extension. (#8293,
    @emillon)

We're pleased to announce the release of Dune 3.11!

Here are some highlights from this release.

### Dune Terminal User Interface (TUI)

The biggest highlight in this release is the introduction of the new Terminal User Interface (TUI) display mode.

You can now run `dune build --display tui` to open a TUI. We recommend using it in conjunction with Dune watch
mode (`dune build -w --display tui`).

From the TUI, you will be able to navigate messages from Dune build, scroll through them, or click to minimize them. Press `?` to show the help screen.

### Installing Source Directories

Another exciting feature in this release is the [new `(source_trees ..)` field](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#installing-source-directories) added to the `(install ..)` stanzas to add every files in a directory to the installation. For instance, to add your manual to the installation, you can use:

```
(install
 (section doc)
 (source_trees manual))
```
