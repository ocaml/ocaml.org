title: Dune 3.9.0
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  ## Added
  
  - Include the time it takes to read/write state files when `--trace-file` is
    enabled ([#7960](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7960), @rgrinberg)
  
  - Include source tree scans in the traces produced by `--trace-file` ([#7937](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7937),
    @rgrinberg)
  
  - Add `--all` option to `dune rpc status` to show all Dune RPC servers running.
    ([#8011](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8011), fix [#7902](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7902), @Alizter)
  
  - Add additional metadata to the traces provided by `--trace-file` whenever
    `--trace-extended` is passed ([#7778](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7778), @rleshchinskiy)
  
  - `$ dune describe` is now a command group, so arguments to subcommands must be
    passed after subcommand itself. ([#7919](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7919), @Alizter)
  
  - Add `dune show` command group which is an alias of `dune describe`. ([#7946](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7946),
    @Alizter)
  
  - Add `dune show env` command and make `dune printenv` an alias of it. ([#7985](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7985),
    @Alizter)
  
  - Add commands `dune show targets` and `dune show aliases` that display all the
    available targets and aliases in a given directory respectively. ([#7770](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7770),
    grants [#265](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/265), @Alizter)
  
  - Extensions used in `(dialect)` can contain periods (e.g., `cppo.ml`). ([#7782](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7782),
    fixes [#7777](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7777), @nojb)
  
  - The `interface` and `implementation` fields of a `(dialect)` are now optional
    ([#7757](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7757), @gpetiot)

  - Add `(build_if)` to the `(test)` stanza. When it evaluates to false, the
    executable is not built. ([#7899](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7899), fixes [#6938](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/6938), @emillon)
  
  - Allow `(include_subdirs qualified)` to be used when libraries define a
    `(modules ...)` field ([#7797](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7797), fixes [#7597](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7597), @anmonteiro)
  
  - Allow multiple globs in library's `(stdlib (internal_modules ..))`
    (@anmonteiro, [#7878](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7878))
  
  ## Changed
  
  - Do not rerun OCaml syntax files on every iteration of the watch mode. This
    is too memory consuming. ([#7894](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7894), fix [#6900](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/6900), @rgrinberg)
  
  - Attach melange rules to the default alias ([#7926](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7926), @haochenx)
  
  - Compute digests and manage sandboxes in background threads ([#7947](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7947),
    @rgrinberg)
  
  ## Fixed
  
  - Validate file extension for `$ dune ocaml top-module`. ([#8005](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8005), fixes [#8004](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8004),
    @3Rafal)
  
  - Cinaps: The promotion rules for cinaps would only offer one file at a time no
    matter how many promotions were available. Now we offer all the promotions at
    once ([#7901](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7901), @rgrinberg)
  
  - Add necessary parentheses in generated opam constraints ([#7682](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7682), fixes [#3431](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/3431),
    @Lucccyo)
  
  ## Removed
  
  - Remove some compatibility code for old version of dune that generated
    `.merlin` files. Now dune will never remove `.merlin` files automatically
    ([#7562](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7562))
  
  - In opam constraints, reject `(and)` and `(or)` with no arguments at parse
    time ([#7730](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7730), @emillon)

The Dune team is thrilled to announce the release of Dune 3.9.0. This version ships with a host of new features and improvements, including:

- **New `dune show` Command:** This command enables you to display various pieces of information. For instance, you can use `dune show pp` to display the preprocessed output of a file or `dune show aliases [DIR]` to list the aliases available in `DIR`. Read more about the command on its manpage using `dune show --help`.
- **Improved Dialect Support:** We have rolled out several fixes related to dialect support. These changes make it easier to work with Dream's `.eml` files.
- **Introduction of `(build_if)` Toggle in `(test)` Stanza:** This new field facilitates the packaging of non-portable tests and benchmarks. If you have tests that don't build on a specific platform, you can now tell Dune not to build them on other Platforms with the `build_if` field.

Enjoy the new features and improvements incorporated into this version!
