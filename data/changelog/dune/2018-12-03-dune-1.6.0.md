title: Dune 1.6.0
date: "2018-12-03"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Expand variables in `install` stanzas (#1354, @mseri)

  - Add predicate language support for specifying sub directories. This allows the
    use globs, set operations, and special values in specifying the sub
    directories used for the build. For example: `(dirs :standard \ lib*)` will
    use all directories except those that start with `lib`. (#1517, #1568,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Add `binaries` field to the `(env ..)` stanza. This field sets and overrides
    binaries for rules defined in a directory. (#1521, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix a crash caused by using an extension in a project without
    dune-project file (#1535, fix #1529, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow `%{bin:..}`, `%{exe:..}`, and other static expansions in the `deps`
    field. (#1155, fix #1531, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix bad interaction between on-demand ppx rewriters and using multiple build
    contexts (#1545, @jeremiedimino)

  - Fix handling of installed .dune files when the backend is declared via a
    `dune` file (#1551, fixes #1549, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add a `--stats` command line option to record resource usage (#1543, @jeremiedimino)

  - Fix `dune build @doc` deleting `highlight.pack.js` on rebuilds, after the
    first build (#1557, @aantron).

  - Allow targets to be directories, which Dune will treat opaquely
    (#1547, @jordwalke)

  - Support for OCaml 4.08: `List.t` is now provided by OCaml (#1561, @ejgallego)

  - Exclude the local esy directory (`_esy`) from the list of watched directories
    (#1578, @andreypopp)

  - Fix the output of `dune external-lib-deps` (#1594, @jeremiedimino)

  - Introduce `data_only_dirs` to replace `ignored_subdirs`. `ignored_subdirs` is
    deprecated since 1.6. (#1590, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `dune external-lib-deps --sexp --unstable-by-dir` so that the output can
    be easily processed by a machine (#1599, @jeremiedimino)

The dune team is pleased to announce the release of Dune 1.6.0. This release does not contain any notable features or bug fixes that need to be specifically pointed out. Nevertheless, I expect that this will be a quality of life improvement to power users who have experienced dune's sharper corners.

Happy hacking!
