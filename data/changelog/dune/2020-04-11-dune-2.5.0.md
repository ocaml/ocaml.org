title: Dune 2.5.0
date: "2020-04-11"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Add a `--release` option meaning the same as `-p` but without the
    package filtering. This is useful for custom `dune` invocation in opam
    files where we don't want `-p` (#3260, @jeremiedimino)

  - Fix a bug introduced in 2.4.0 causing `.bc` programs to be built
    with `-custom` by default (#3269, fixes #3262, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow contexts to be defined with local switches in workspace files (#3265,
    fix #3264, @rgrinberg)

  - Delay expansion errors until the rule is used to build something (#3261, fix
    #3252, @rgrinberg, @jeremiedimino)

  - [coq] Support for theory dependencies and compositional builds using
    new field `(theories ...)` (#2053, @ejgallego, @rgrinberg)

  - From now on, each version of a syntax extension must be explicitely tied to a
    minimum version of the dune language. Inconsistent versions in a
    `dune-project` will trigger a warning for version <=2.4 and an error for
    versions >2.4 of the dune language. (#3270, fixes #2957, @voodoos)

  - [coq] Bump coq lang version to 0.2. New coq features presented this release
    require this version of the coq lang. (#3283, @ejgallego)

  - Prevent installation of public executables disabled using the `enabled_if` field.
    Installation will now simply skip such executables instead of raising an
    error. (#3195, @voodoos)

  - `dune upgrade` will now try to upgrade projects using versions <2.0 to version
    2.0 of the dune language. (#3174, @voodoos)

  - Add a `top` command to integrate dune with any toplevel, not just
    utop. It is meant to be used with the new `#use_output` directive of
    OCaml 4.11 (#2952, @mbernat, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow per-package `version` in generated `opam` files (#3287, @toots)

  - [coq] Introduce the `coq.extraction` stanza. It can be used to extract OCaml
    sources (#3299, fixes #2178, @rgrinberg)

  - Load ppx rewriters in dune utop and add pps field to toplevel stanza. Ppx
    extensions will now be usable in the toplevel
    (#3266, fixes #346, @stephanieyou)

  - Add a `(subdir ..)` stanza to allow evaluating stanzas in sub directories.
    (#3268, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix a bug preventing one from running inline tests in multiple modes
    (#3352, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow the use of the `%{profile}` variable in the `enabled_if` field of the
    library stanza. (#3344, @mrmr1993)

  - Allow the use of `%{ocaml_version}` variable in `enabled_if` field of the
    library stanza. (#3339, @voodoos)

  - Fix dune build freezing on MacOS when cache is enabled. (#3249, fixes ##2973,
    @artempyanykh)

The dune team is pleased to announce the release of dune 2.5.0. This release has been brewing for a while and contains a few interesting features. I'll highlight some of the bigger ones:

* The coq support has been thoroughly extended. There's now support for both composition of coq libraries in the same workspace and extraction of coq code to OCaml.

* There's a new `$ dune upgrade` subcommand to help you upgrade dune files from 1.x to 2.x

* `$ dune utop` will now load ppx preprocessors to the toplevel. Ppx authors might enjoy this style of interactive development.

* There's a new `(subdir ..)` stanza that can be used to evaluate stanzas in sub directories. This makes it possible to have a single dune file for an entire project (generated or not).

I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to dune 2.5.0. Your help is greatly appreciated.
