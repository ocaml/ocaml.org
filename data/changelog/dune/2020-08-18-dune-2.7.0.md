title: Dune 2.7.0
date: "2020-08-18"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Write intermediate files in a `.mdx` folder for each `mdx` stanza
    to prevent the corresponding actions to be executed as part of the `@all`
    alias (#3659, @NathanReb)

  - Read Coq flags from `env` (#3547 , fixes #3486, @gares)

  - Allow bisect_ppx to be enabled/disabled via dune-workspace. (#3404,
    @stephanieyou)

  - Formatting of dune files is now done in the executing dune process instead of
    in a separate process. (#3536, @nojb)

  - Add a `--debug-artifact-substution` flag to help debug problem with
    version not being captured by `dune-build-info` (#3589,
    @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow the use of the `context_name` variable in the `enabled_if` fields of
    executable(s) and install stanzas. (#3568, fixes #3566, @voodoos)

  - Fix compatibility with OCaml 4.12.0 when compiling empty archives; no .a file
    is generated. (#3576, @dra27)

  - `$ dune utop` no longer tries to load optional libraries that are unavailable
    (#3612, fixes #3188, @anuragsoni)

  - Fix dune-build-info on 4.10.0+flambda (#3599, @emillon, @jeremiedimino).

  - Allow multiple libraries with `inline_tests` to be defined in the same
    directory (#3621, @rgrinberg)

  - Run exit hooks in jsoo separate compilation mode (#3626, fixes #3622,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Add (alias ...), (mode ...) fields to (copy_fields ...) stanza (#3631, @nojb)

  - (copy_files ...) now supports copying files from outside the workspace using
    absolute file names (#3639, @nojb)

  - Dune does not use `ocamlc` as an intermediary to call C compiler anymore.
    Configuration flags `ocamlc_cflags` and `ocamlc_cppflags` are always prepended
    to the compiler arguments. (#3565, fixes #3346, @voodoos)

  - Revert the build optimization in #2268. This optimization slows down building
    individual executables when they're part of an `executables` stanza group
    (#3644, @rgrinberg)

  - Use `{dev}` rather than `{pinned}` in the generated `.opam` file. (#3647,
    @kit-ty-kate)

  - Insert correct extension name when editing `dune-project` files. Previously,
    dune would just insert the stanza name. (#3649, fixes #3624, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix crash when evaluating an `mdx` stanza that depends on unavailable
    packages. (#3650, @CraigFe)

  - Fix typo in `cache-check-probablity` field in dune config files. This field
    now requires 2.7 as it wasn't usable before this version. (#3652, @edwintorok)

  - Add `"odoc" {with-doc}` to the dependencies in the generated `.opam` files.
    (#3667, @kit-ty-kate)

  - Do not allow user actions to capture dune's stdin (#3677, fixes #3672,
    @rgrinberg)

  - `(subdir ...)` stanzas can now appear in dune files used via `(include ...)`.
    (#3676, @nojb)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the release of dune 2.7.0.
This release adds a couple of important features and many bug fixes. I'll just briefly summarize the two features, and let our improved documentation elaborate on the details.

The first one is first class support for instrumentation tools such as bisect_ppx and landmarks. This is one of the most requested dune features ever, and we're pleased to show you all what [we've come up with](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instrumentation.html)

Special thanks to @stephanieyou & @nojb for implementing this feature. Many thanks to @aantron for tirelessly iterating on the end user experience with us.

While the features is looking quite good already, we consider it a "first take" on this subject. We welcome your experience reports and feature requests.

The second feature we're introducing this release is dune's cram testing framework. The cram framework is our secret weapon for making dune (relatively) bug free. I'll soon write up a dedicated post to give you a flavour of how it works. To those who can't wait, there's a [new section](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tests.html#cram-tests) in the documentation that explains everything.

As always, the change log is replicated below for your convenience.

Happy Hacking.
