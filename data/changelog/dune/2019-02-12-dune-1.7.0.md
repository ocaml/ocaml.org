title: Dune 1.7.0
date: "2019-02-12"
tags: [dune, platform, release]
changelog: |
  - Second step of the deprecation of jbuilder: the `jbuilder` binary
    now emits a warning on every startup and both `jbuilder` and `dune`
    emit warnings when encountering `jbuild` files (#1752, @jeremiedimino)

  - Change the layout of build artifacts inside _build. The new layout enables
    optimizations that depend on the presence of `.cmx` files of private modules
    (#1676, @bobot)

  - Fix merlin handling of private module visibility (#1653 @bobot)

  - unstable-fmt: use boxes to wrap some lists (#1608, fix #1153, @emillon,
    thanks to @rgrinberg)

  - skip directories when looking up programs in the PATH (#1628, fixes
    #1616, @jeremiedimino)

  - Use `lsof` on macOS to implement `--stats` (#1636, fixes #1634, @xclerc)

  - Generate `dune-package` files for every package. These files are installed and
    read instead of `META` files whenever they are available (#1329, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix preprocessing for libraries with `(include_subdirs ..)` (#1624, fix #1626,
    @nojb, @rgrinberg)

  - Do not generate targets for archive that don't match the `modes` field.
    (#1632, fix #1617, @rgrinberg)

  - When executing actions, open files lazily and close them as soon as
    possible in order to reduce the maximum number of file descriptors
    opened by Dune (#1635, #1643, fixes #1633, @jonludlam, @rgrinberg,
    @jeremiedimino)

  - Reimplement the core of Dune using a new generic memoization system
    (#1489, @rudihorn, @jeremiedimino)

  - Replace the broken cycle detection algorithm by a state of the art
    one from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/2756553) (#1489,
    @rudihorn)

  - Get the correct environment node for multi project workspaces (#1648,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Add `dune compute` to call internal memoized functions (#1528,
    @rudihorn, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add `--trace-file` option to trace dune internals (#1639, fix #1180, @emillon)

  - Add `--no-print-directory` (borrowed from GNU make) to suppress
    `Entering directory` messages. (#1668, @dra27)

  - Remove `--stats` and track fd usage in `--trace-file` (#1667, @emillon)

  - Add virtual libraries feature and enable it by default (#1430 fixes #921,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Fix handling of Control+C in watch mode (#1678, fixes #1671, @jeremiedimino)

  - Look for jsoo runtime in the same dir as the `js_of_ocaml` binary
    when the ocamlfind package is not available (#1467, @nojb)

  - Make the `seq` package available for OCaml >= 4.07 (#1714, @rgrinberg)

  - Add locations to error messages where a rule fails to generate targets and
    rules that require files outside the build/source directory. (#1708, fixes
    #848, @rgrinberg)

  - Let `Configurator` handle `sizeof` (in addition to negative numbers).
    (#1726, fixes #1723, @Chris00)

  - Fix an issue causing menhir generated parsers to fail to build in
    some cases. The fix is to systematically use `-short-paths` when
    calling `ocamlc -i` (#1743, fix #1504, @jeremiedimino)

  - Never raise when printing located errors. The code that would print the
    location excerpts was prone to raising. (#1744, fix #1736, @rgrinberg)

  - Add a `dune upgrade` command for upgrading jbuilder projects to Dune
    (#1749, @jeremiedimino)

  - When automatically creating a `dune-project` file, insert the
    detected name in it (#1749, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add `(implicit_transitive_deps <bool>)` mode to dune projects. When this mode
    is turned off, transitive dependencies are not accessible. Only listed
    dependencies are directly accessible. (#1734, #430, @rgrinberg, @hnrgrgr)

  - Add `toplevel` stanza. This stanza is used to define toplevels with libraries
    already preloaded. (#1713, @rgrinberg)

  - Generate `.merlin` files that account for normal preprocessors defined using a
    subset of the `action` language. (#1768, @rgrinberg)

  - Emit `(orig_src_dir <path>)` metadata in `dune-package` for dune packages
    built with `--store-orig-source-dir` command line flag (also controlled by
    `DUNE_STORE_ORIG_SOURCE_DIR` env variable). This is later used to generate
    `.merlin` with `S`-directives pointed to original source locations and thus
    allowing merlin to see those. (#1750, @andreypopp)

  - Improve the behavior of `dune promote` when the files to be promoted have been
    deleted. (#1775, fixes #1772, @jeremiedimino)

  - unstable-fmt: preserve comments (#1766, @emillon)

  - Pass flags correctly when using `staged_pps` (#1779, fixes #1774, @jeremiedimino)

  - Fix an issue with the use of `(mode promote)` in the menhir
    stanza. It was previously causing intermediate *mock* files to be
    promoted (#1783, fixes #1781, @jeremiedimino)

  - unstable-fmt: ignore files using OCaml syntax (#1784, @emillon)

  - Configurator: Add `which` function to replace the `which` command line utility
    in a cross platform way. (#1773, fixes #1705, @Chris00)

  - Make configurator append paths to `$PKG_CONFIG_PATH` on macOS. Previously it
    was prepending paths and thus `$PKG_CONFIG_PATH` set by users could have been
    overridden by homebrew installed libraries (#1785, @andreypopp)

  - Disallow c/cxx sources that share an object file in the same stubs archive.
    This means that `foo.c` and `foo.cpp` can no longer exist in the same library.
    (#1788, @rgrinberg)

  - Forbid use of `%{targets}` (or `${@}` in jbuild files) inside
    preprocessing actions
    (#1812, fixes #1811, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add `DUNE_PROFILE` environment variable to easily set the profile. (#1806,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Deprecate the undocumented `(no_keep_locs)` field. It was only
    necessary until virtual libraries were supported (#1822, fix #1816,
    @jeremiedimino)

  - Rename `unstable-fmt` to `format-dune-file` and remove its `--inplace` option.
    (#1821, @emillon).

  - Autoformatting: `(using fmt 1.1)` will also format dune files (#1821, @emillon).

  - Autoformatting: record dependencies on `.ocamlformat-ignore` files (#1824,
    fixes #1793, @emillon)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the release of dune 1.7.0. This release is the biggest release since 1.0 and I'm excited to present it to you. The change log is quite long so I'll summarize the most noteworthy changes:

* The jbuilder binary and jbuild files are officially deprecated. But not to worry, we've created a `$ dune upgrade` command to do the hard work for you.

* The virtual libraries feature has made it to 1.7.0. I've blogged about it [before](http://rgrinberg.com/posts/virtual-libraries/)

* There's now a [mode](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-topics.html#implicit-transitive-deps - [404 Not Found]) to disable transitive dependencies. This mode still has some caveats because it lacks proper compiler support. But we welcome user reports regarding its usability.

* Dune now has a `--trace-file` to profile slow builds using shiny flame graphs in Chrome.
