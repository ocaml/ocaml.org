title: Dune 1.9.0
date: "2019-04-09"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Warn when generated `.merlin` does not reflect the preprocessing
    specification. This occurs when multiple stanzas in the same directory use
    different preprocessing specifications. This warning can now be disabled with
    `allow_approx_merlin` (#1947, fix #1946, @rgrinberg)

  - Watch mode: display "Success" in green and "Had errors" in red (#1956,
    @emillon)

  - Fix glob dependencies on installed directories (#1965, @rgrinberg)

  - Add support for library variants and default implementations. (#1900,
    @TheLortex)

  - Add experimental `$ dune init` command. This command is used to create or
    update project boilerplate. (#1448, fixes #159, @shonfeder)

  - Experimental Coq support (fix #1466, @ejgallego)

  - Install .cmi files of private modules in a `.private` directory (#1983, fix
    #1973 @rgrinberg)

  - Fix `dune subst` attempting to substitute on directories. (#2000, fix #1997,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Do not list private modules in the generated index. (#2009, fix #2008,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Warn instead of failing if an opam file fails to parse. This opam file can
    still be used to define scope. (#2023, @rgrinberg)

  - Do not crash if unable to read a directory when traversing to find root
    (#2024, @rgrinberg)

  - Do not exit dune if some source directories are unreadable. Instead, warn the
    user that such directories need to be ignored (#2004, fix #310, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix nested `(binaries ..)` fields in the `env` stanza. Previously, parent
    `binaries` fields would be ignored, but instead they should be combined.
    (#2029, @rgrinberg)

  - Allow "." in `c_names` and `cxx_names` (#2036, fix #2033, @rgrinberg)

  - Format rules: if a dune file uses OCaml syntax, do not format it.
    (#2014, fix #2012, @emillon)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the release of Dune 1.9.0. This release  introduces a few exciting new features:

* A tagging mechanism for implementations called [variants](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/variants.html)
* The ability to build libraries in the Coq proof assistant.
* A new `dune init` command to help users quickly generate boilerplate and get start with dune projects (contributed by @shonfeder)

I would like to thank Lucas Pluvinage and @ejgallego for contributing the first two features respectively. They've also collaborated on a [blog post](https://dune.build/blog/dune-1-9-0/) to describe these features in detail.
