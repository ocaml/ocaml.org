We are excited to announce the release of Dune 3.7.1, which brings a few bug
fixes from the recent 3.7.0 release:

- Resolved watch mode issue for executables on macOS: We have addressed a
  problem with the recently introduced watch mode for executables that was

  without unexpected crashes on macOS.

  Dune build failures with a "Too many links" error on Windows when using Dune
  cache.
