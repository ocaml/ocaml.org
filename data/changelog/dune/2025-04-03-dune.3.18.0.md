title: Dune 3.18.0
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
    ### Fixed

    - Support HaikuOS: don't call `execve` since it's not allowed if other pthreads
      have been created. The fact that Haiku can't call `execve` from other threads
      than the principal thread of a process (a team in haiku jargon), is a
      discrepancy to POSIX and hence there is a [bug about
      it](https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/18665). (@Sylvain78, #10953)

    - Fix flag ordering in generated Merlin configurations (#11503, @voodoos, fixes
      ocaml/merlin#1900, reported by @vouillon)

    ### Added

    - Add `(format-dune-file <src> <dst>)` action. It provides a replacement to
      `dune format-dune-file` command.  (#11166, @nojb)

    - Allow the `--prefix` flag when configuring dune with `ocaml configure.ml`.
      This allows to set the prefix just like `$ dune install --prefix`. (#11172,
      @rgrinberg)

    - Allow arguments starting with `+` in preprocessing definitions (starting with
      `(lang dune 3.18)`). (@amonteiro, #11234)

    - Support for opam `(maintenance_intent ...)` in dune-project (#11274, @art-w)

    - Validate opam `maintenance_intent` (#11308, @art-w)

    - Support `not` in package dependencies constraints (#11404, @art-w, reported
      by @hannesm)

    ### Changed

    - Warn when failing to discover root due to reads failing. The previous
      behavior was to abort. (@KoviRobi, #11173)

    - Use shorter path for inline-tests artifacts. (@hhugo, #11307)

    - Allow dash in `dune init` project name (#11402, @art-w, reported by @saroupille)

    - On Windows, under heavy load, file delete operations can sometimes fail due to
      AV programs, etc. Guard against it by retrying the operation up to 30x with a
      1s waiting gap (#11437, fixes #11425, @MSoegtropIMC)

    - Cache: we now only store the executable permission bit for files (#11541,
      fixes #11533, @ElectreAAS)

    - Display negative error codes on Windows in hex which is the more customary
      way to display `NTSTATUS` codes (#11504, @MisterDA)

The Dune Team is happy to announce the release of Dune `3.18.0`!

This release contains changes to support the new `x-maintenance-intent` field
by default. It also contains some changes regarding the cache about how it
handles file permissions. It introduces a new `(format-dune-file ...)` stanza
with the intention to formalize the `dune format-dune-file` command as an inside
rule. Finally, it includes various bug fixes for Dune.
