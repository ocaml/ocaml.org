date: "2022-04-18"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Add `sourcehut` as an option for defining project sources in dune-project
    files. For example, `(source (sourcehut user/repo))`. (#5564, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `dune coq top` command for running a Coq toplevel (#5457, @rlepigre)

  - Fix dune exec dumping database in wrong directory (#5544, @bobot)

    (#5539, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `(deps <deps>)` in ctype field (#5346, @bobot)

  - Add `(include <file>)` constructor to dependency specifications. This can be
    used to introduce dynamic dependencies (#5442, @anmonteiro)

  - Ensure that `dune describe` computes a transitively closed set of
    libraries (#5395, @esope)

  - Add direct dependencies to $ dune describe output (#5412, @esope)

  - Show auto-detected concurrency on Windows too (#5502, @MisterDA)

    using esy (#5507, @EduardoRFS)

  - Dune will not fail if some directories are non-empty when uninstalling.
    (#5543, fixes #5542, @nojb)

  - `coqdep` now depends only on the filesystem layout of the .v files,
    and not on their contents (#5547, helps with #5100, @ejgallego)

  - The mdx stanza 0.2 can now be used with `(implicit_transitive_deps false)`
    (#5558, fixes #5499, @emillon)

  - Fix missing parenthesis in printing of corresponding terminal command for
    `(with-outputs-to )` (#5551, fixes #5546, @Alizter)
