In Dune 3.7.0, we introduced version `0.3` of the `mdx` stanza, which came with support for `.mld` files.

In Dune 3.8.0, `.mld` files are now supported by default with version `0.4` of the `mdx` stanza!

Have a look at [this diff](https://github.com/tmattio/demo-mdx-mld/compare/dune-3-8-0) to see how to migrate your code to the new stanza version.
