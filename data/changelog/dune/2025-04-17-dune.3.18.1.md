    ### Fixed

    - fix: pass pkg-config (extra) args in all pkgconfig invocations. A missing
      `--personality` flag would result in pkgconf not finding libraries in some
      contexts. (#11619, @MisterDA)

The Dune Team is happy to announce the release of Dune `3.18.1`!

This release contains a bug fix for `pkg-config` that prevents it from finding some
libraries in specific contexts.
