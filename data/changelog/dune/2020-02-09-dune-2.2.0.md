title: Dune 2.2.0
date: "2020-02-09"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - `dune test` is now a command alias for `dune runtest`. This is to make the CLI
    less idiosyncratic (#3006, @shonfeder)

  - Allow to set menhir flags in the `env` stanza using the `menhir_flags` field.
    (#2960, fix #2924, @bschommer)

  - By default, do not show the full command line of commands executed
    by `dune` when `dune` is executed inside `dune`. This is to make
    integration tests more reproducible (#3042, @diml)

  - `dune subst` now works even without opam files (#2955, fixes #2910,
    @fangyi-zhou and @diml)

  - Hint when trying to execute an executable defined in the current directory
    without using the `./` prefix (#3041, fixes #1094, @voodoos).

  - Extend the list of modifiers that can be nested under
    `with-accepted-exit-codes` with `chdir`,  `setenv`, `ignore-<outputs>`,
    `with-stdin-from` and `with-<outputs>-to` (#3027, fixes #3014, @voodoos)

  - It is now an error to have a preprocessing dependency on a ppx rewriter
    library that is not marked as `(kind ppx_rewriter)` (#3039, @snowleopard).

  - Fix permissions of files promoted to the source tree when using the
    shared cache. In particular, make them writable by the user (#3043,
    fixes #3026, @diml)

  - Only detect internal OCaml tools with `.opt` extensions. Previously, this
    detection applied to other binaries as well (@kit-ty-kate, @rgrinberg, #3051).

  - Give the user a proper error message when they try to promote into a source
    directory that doesn't exist. (#3073, fix #3069, @rgrinberg)

  - Correctly build vendored packages in `-p` mode. These packages were
    incorrectly filtered out before. (#3075, @diml)

  - Do not install vendored packages (#3074, @diml)

  - `make` now prints a message explaining the main targets available
    (#3085, fix #3078, @diml)

  - Add a `byte_complete` executable mode to build programs as
    self-contained bytecode programs
    (#3076, fixes #1519, @diml)
