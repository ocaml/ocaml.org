title: Dune 2.7.1
date: "2020-09-06"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - configurator: More flexible probing of `#define`. We allow duplicate values in
    the object file, as long as they are the same after parsing. (#3739, fixes
    #3736, @rgrinberg)

  - Record instrumentation backends in dune-package files. This makes it possible
    to use instrumentation backends defined in installed libraries (eg via OPAM).
    (#3735, @nojb)

  - Add missing `.aux` & `.glob` targets to coq rules (#3721, fixes #3437,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Fix `dune-package` installation when META templates are present (#3743, fixes
    #3746, @rgrinberg)

  - Resolve symlinks before running `$ git diff` (#3750, fixes #3740, @rgrinberg)

  - Cram tests: when checking that all test directories contain a `run.t` file,
    skip empty directories. These can be left around by git. (#3753, @emillon)
