title: Dune 3.4.0
date: "2022-07-21"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Make `dune describe` correctly handle overlapping implementations
    for virtual libraries (#5971, fixes #5747, @esope)

  - Building the `@check` alias should make sure the libraries and executables
    don't have dependency cycles (#5892, @rgrinberg)

  - [ctypes] Add support for the `errno` parameter using the `errno_policy` field
    in the ctypes settings. (#5827, @droyo)

  - Fix `dune coq top` when it is invoked on files from a subdirectory of the
    directory containing the associated stanza (#5784, fixes #5552, @ejgallego,
    @rlepigre, @Alizter)

  - Fix hint when an invalid module name is found. (#5922, fixes #5273, @emillon)

  - The `(cat)` action now supports several files. (#5928, fixes #5795, @emillon)

  - Dune no longer uses shimmed `META` files for OCaml 5.x, solely using the ones
    installed by the compiler. (#5916, @dra27)

  - Fix handling of the `(deps)` field in `(test)` stanzas when there is an
    `.expected` file. (#5952, #5951, fixes #5950, @emillon)

  - Ignore insignificant filesystem events. This stops RPC in watch mode from
    flashing errors on insignificant file system events such as changes in the
    `.git/` directory. (#5953, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix parsing more error messages emitted by the OCaml compiler. In
    particular, messages where the excerpt line number started with a blank
    character were skipped. (#5981, @rgrinberg)

  - env stanza: warn if some rules are ignored because they appear after a
    wildcard rule. (#5898, fixes #5886, @emillon)

  - On Windows, XDG_CACHE_HOME is taken to be the `FOLDERID_InternetCache` if
    unset, and XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_DATA_HOME are both taken to be
    `FOLDERID_LocalAppData` if unset.  (#5943, fixes #5808, @nojb)
