title: Dune 1.11.2
date: "2019-08-21"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Remove the optimisation of passing `-nodynlink` for executables when
    not necessary. It seems to be breaking things (see #2527, @diml)

  - Fix invalid library names in `dune-package` files. Only public names should
    exist in such files. (#2558, fix #2425, @rgrinberg)
