Dune 3.7 now supports watch mode for executables! ðŸŽ‰

It works just as you'd expect, if you define an executable, you can run it with

```sh
dune exec -w my-executable
```

It will interrupt the process when a file change and re-start the application.

For a practical example of the workflows enabled by watch-mode, check

reload for web development:
