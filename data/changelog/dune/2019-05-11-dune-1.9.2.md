title: Dune 1.9.2
date: "2019-05-11"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Put back library variants in development mode. We discovered a
    serious unexpected issue and we might need to adjust the design of
    this feature before we are ready to commit to a final version. Users
    will need to write `(using library_variants 0.1)` in their
    `dune-project` file if they want to use it before the design is
    finalized. (#2116, @diml)

  - Forbid to attach a variant to a library that implements a virtual
    library outside the current project (#2104, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix a bug where `dune install` would install man pages to incorrect
    paths when compared to `opam-installer`. For example dune now
    installs `(foo.1 as man1/foo.1)` correctly and previously that was
    installed to `man1/man1/foo.1`. (#2105, @aalekseyev)

  - Do not fail when a findlib directory doesn't exist (#2101, fix #2099, @diml)

  - [coq] Rename `(coqlib ...)` to `(coq.theory ...)`, support for
    `coqlib` will be dropped in the 1.0 version of the Coq language
    (#2055, @ejgallego)

  - Fix crash when calculating library dependency closure (#2090, fixes #2085,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Clean up the special support for `findlib.dynload`. Before, Dune
    would simply match on the library name. Now, we only match on the
    findlib package name when the library doesn't come from
    Dune. Someone writing a library called `findlib.dynload` with Dune
    would have to add `(special_builton_support findlib_dynload)` to
    trigger the special behavior. (#2115, @diml)

  - Include permissions in the digest of targets and dependencies (#2121, fix
    #1426, @rgrinberg, @xclerc)
