  ## Fixes

  - Disable background digests on Windows. This prevents an issue where
    unremovable files would make Dune crash when the shared cache is enabled.
    (#8243, fixes #8228, @emillon)
  
  - Fix permission errors when `sendfile` is not available (#8234, fixes #8210,
    @emillon)

This bugfix-only release contains two platform-specific changes: one fixes the
Dune cache on Windows, and the other one completes the fix on Linux when
`sendfile` is not available. This makes Dune available where user directories
are encrypted using `ecryptfs` for example.
