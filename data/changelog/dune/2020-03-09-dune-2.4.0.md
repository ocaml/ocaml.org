On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the release of dune 2.4.0. This releases features support for [mdx](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx), an interesting take on the notebook paradigm by the RWO team. This release also includes a crucial fix to polling mode which makes it usable in environments with finite memory :slight_smile:.

Happy hacking!
