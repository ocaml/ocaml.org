title: Dune 2.0.0
date: "2019-11-23"
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Remove existing destination files in `install`  before installing the new
    ones. (#2885, fixes #2883, @bschommer)

  - The `action` field in the `alias` stanza is not available starting `lang dune
    2.0`. The `alias` field in the `rule` stanza is a replacement. (#2846, fixes
    2681, @rgrinberg)

  - Introduce `alias` and `package` fields to the `rule` stanza. This is the
    preferred way of attaching rules to aliases. (#2744, @rgrinberg)

  - Add field `(optional)` for executable stanzas (#2463, fixes #2433, @bobot)

  - Infer targets for rule stanzas expressed in long form (#2494, fixes #2469,
    @NathanReb)

  - Indicate the progress of the initial file tree loading (#2459, fixes #2374,
    @bobot)

  - Build `.cm[ox]` files for executables more eagerly. This speeds up builds at
    the cost of building unnecessary artifacts in some cases. Some of these extra
    artifacts can fail to built, so this is a breaking change. (#2268, @rgrinberg)

  - Do not put the `<package>.install` files in the source tree unless `-p` or
    `--promote-install-files` is passed on the command line (#2329, @jeremiedimino)

  - Compilation units of user defined executables are now mangled by default. This
    is done to prevent the accidental collision with library dependencies of the
    executable. (#2364, fixes #2292, @rgrinberg)

  - Enable `(explicit_js_mode)` by default. (#1941, @nojb)

  - Add an option to clear the console in-between builds with
  `--terminal-persistence=clear-on-rebuild`

  - Stop symlinking object files to main directory for stanzas defined `jbuild`
    files (#2440, @rgrinberg)

  - Library names are now validated in a strict fashion. Previously, invalid names
    would be allowed for unwrapped libraries (#2442, @rgrinberg)

  - mli only modules must now be explicitly declared. This was previously a
    warning and is now an error. (#2442, @rgrinberg)

  - Modules filtered out from the module list via the Ordered Set Language must
    now be actual modules. (#2442, @rgrinberg)

  - Actions which introduce targets where new targets are forbidden (e.g.
    preprocessing) are now an error instead of a warning. (#2442, @rgrinberg)

  - No longer install a `jbuilder` binary. (#2441, @jeremiedimino)

  - Stub names are no longer allowed relative paths. This was previously a warning
    and is now an error (#2443, @rgrinberg).

  - Define (paths ...) fields in (context ...) definitions in order to set or
    extend any PATH-like variable in the context environment. (#2426, @nojb)

  - The `diff` action will always normalize newlines before diffing. Perviousy, it
    would not do this normalization for rules defined in jbuild files. (#2457,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Modules may no longer belong to more than one stanza. This was previously
    allowed only in stanzas defined in `jbuild` files. (#2458, @rgrinberg)

  - Remove support for `jbuild-ignore` files. They have been replaced by the the
    `dirs` stanza in `dune` files. (#2456, @rgrinberg)

  - Add a new config option `sandboxing_preference`, the cli argument `--sandbox`,
    and the dep spec `sandbox` in dune language. These let the user control the level of
    sandboxing done by dune per rule and globally. The rule specification takes precedence.
    The global configuration merely specifies the default.
    (#2213, @aalekseyev, @jeremiedimino)

  - Remove support for old style subsystems. Dune will now emit a warning to
    reinstall the library with the old style subsystem. (#2480, @rgrinberg)

  - Add action (with-stdin-from <file> <action>) to redirect input from <file>
    when performing <action>. (#2487, @nojb)

  - Change the automatically generated odoc index to only list public modules.
    This only affects unwrapped libraries (#2479, @rgrinberg)

  - Set up formatting rules by default. They can be configured through a new
    `(formatting)` stanza in `dune-project` (#2347, fixes #2315, @emillon)

  - Change default target from `@install` to `@all`. (#2449, fixes #1220,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Include building stubs in `@check` rules. (@rgrinberg, #2530)

  - Get rid of ad-hoc rules for guessing the version. Dune now only
    relies on the version written in the `dune-project` file and no
    longer read `VERSION` or similar files (#2541, @jeremiedimino)

  - In `(diff? x y)` action, require `x` to exist and register a
    dependency on that file. (#2486, @aalekseyev)

  - On Windows, an .exe suffix is no longer added implicitly to binary names that
    already end in .exe. Second, when resolving binary names, .opt variants are no
    longer chosen automatically. (#2543, @nojb)

  - Make `(diff? x y)` move the correction file (`y`) away from the build
    directory to promotion staging area. This makes corrections work with
    sandboxing and in general reduces build directory pollution. (#2486,
    @aalekseyev, fixes #2482)

  - `c_flags`, `c_names` and `cxx_names` are now supported in `executable`
    and `executables` stanzas. (#2562, @nojb)
    Note: this feature has been subsequently extended into a separate
    `foreign_stubs` field. (#2659, RFC #2650, @snowleopard)

  - Remove git integration from `$ dune upgrade` (#2565, @rgrinberg)

  - Add a `--disable-promotion` to disable all modification to the source
    directory. There's also a corresponding `DUNE_DISABLE_PROMOTION` environment
    variable. (#2588, fix #2568, @rgrinberg)

  - Add a `forbidden_libraries` field to prevent some library from being
    linked in an executable. This help detecting who accidently pulls in
    `unix` for instance (#2570, @jeremiedimino)

  - Fix incorrect error message when a variable is expanded in static context:
    `%{lib:lib:..}` when the library does not exist. (#2597, fix #1541,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Add `--sections` option to `$ dune install` to install subsections of .install
    files. This is useful for installing only the binaries in a workspace for
    example. (#2609, fixes #2554, @rgrinberg)

  - Drop support for `jbuild` and `jbuild-ignore` files (#2607, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add a `dune-action-plugin` library for describing dependencies direcly in
    the executable source. Programs that use this feature can be run by a new
    action (dynamic-run <progn> ...). (#2635, @staronj, @aalekseyev)

  - Stop installing the `ocaml-syntax-shims` binary. In order to use
    `future_syntax`, one now need to depend on the `ocaml-syntax-shims`
    package (#2654, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add support for dependencies that are re-exported. Such dependencies
    are marked with`re_export` and will automatically be provided to
    users of a library (#2605, @rgrinberg)

  - Add a `deprecated_library_name` stanza to redirect old names after a
    library has been renamed (#2528, @jeremiedimino)

  - Error out when a `preprocessor_deps` field is present but not
    `preprocess` field is. It is a warning with Dune 1.x projects
    (#2660, @Julow)

  - Dune will use `-output-complete-exe` instead of `-custom` when compiling
    self-contained bytecode executables whenever this options is available
    (OCaml version >= 4.10) (#2692, @nojb)

  - Add action `(with-accepted-exit-codes <pred> <action>)` to specify the set of
    successful exit codes of `<action>`. `<pred>` is specified using the predicate
    language. (#2699, @nojb)

  - Do not setup rules for disabled libraries (#2491, fixes #2272, @bobot)

  - Configurator: filter out empty flags from `pkg-config` (#2716, @AltGr)

  - `no_keep_locs` is a no-op for projects that use `lang dune` older than 2.0. In
    projects where the language is at least `2.0`, the field is now forbidden.
    (#2752, fixes #2747, @rgrinberg)

  - Extend support for foreign sources and archives via the `(foreign_library ...)`
    stanza as well as the `(foreign_stubs ...)` and `(foreign_archives ...)` fields.
    (#2659, RFC #2650, @snowleopard)

  - Add (deprecated_package_names) field to (package) declaration in
    dune-project. The names declared here can be used in the (old_public_name)
    field of (deprecated_library_name) stanza. These names are interpreted as
    library names (not prefixed by a package name) and appropiate redirections are
    setup in their META files. This feaure is meant to migrate old libraries which
    do not follow Dune's convention of prefixing libraries with the package
    name. (#2696, @nojb)

  - The fields `license`, `authors`, `maintainers`, `source`, `bug_reports`,
    `homepage`, and `documentation` of `dune-project` can now be overriden on a
    per-package basis. (#2774, @nojb)

  - Change the default `modes` field of executables to `(mode exe)`. If
    one wants to build a bytecode program, it now needs to be explicitly
    requested via `(modes byte exe)`. (#2851, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow `ccomp_type` as a variable for evaluating `enabled_if`. (#2855, @dra27,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Stricter validation of file names in `select`. The file names of conditional
    sources must match the prefix and the extension of the resultant filename.
    (#2867, @rgrinberg)

  - Add flag `disable_dynamically_linked_foreign_archives` to the workspace file.
    If the flag is set to `true` then: (i) when installing libraries, we do not
    install dynamic foreign archives `dll*.so`; (ii) when building executables in
    the `byte` mode, we statically link in foreign archives into the runtime
    system; (iii) we do not generate any `dll*.so` rules. (#2864, @snowleopard)

  - Reimplement the bootstrap procedure. The new procedure is faster and
    should no longer stack overflow (#2854, @dra27, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow `.opam.template` files to be generated using rules (#2866, @rgrinberg)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm delighted to announce the release of dune 2.0. This release is the culmination of 4 months of hard work by the dune team and contains new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements . Here's a selection of new features that I personally find interesting:

* New boostrap procedure that works in low memory environments
* `(deprecated_library_name ..)` stanza to properly deprecate old library names
*  `(foreign_library ..)` stanza to define C/C++ libraries.
* C stubs directly in OCaml executables

Refer to the change log for an exhaustive list.

We strive for a good out of the box experience that requires no configuration, so we've also tweaked a few defaults. In particular, `$ dune build` will now build `@all` instead of `@install`, and ocamlformat rules are setup by default.

Lastly, dune 2.0 sheds all the legacy related to jbuilder and will no longer build jbuilder projects. This change is necessary to ease maintenance and make it easier to add new features down the line. There are a few other minor breaking changes. Refer to the change log for the full list. We apologize in advance for any convenience this might cause.

Happy Hacking!
