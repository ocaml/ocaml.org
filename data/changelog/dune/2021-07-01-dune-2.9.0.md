Dear all, on behalf of the Dune team I'm pleased to announce the release of Dune 2.9.0. This is the last release on the Dune 2.x series and could be considered a maintenance release as it mostly consists on bug fixes and miscellaneous tweaks and features for sites,
instrumentation, and mdx support.
