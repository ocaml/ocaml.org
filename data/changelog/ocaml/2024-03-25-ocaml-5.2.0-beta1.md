  ### Runtime System Fixes
  
  - [#12875](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12875), [#12879](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12879), [#12882](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12882): Execute preemptive systhread switching as a
    delayed pending action. This ensures that one can reason within the
    FFI that no mutation happens on the same domain when allocating on
    the OCaml heap from C, consistently with OCaml 4. This also fixes
    further bugs with the multicore systhreads implementation.

     Shinwell, review by Nick Barnes and Stephen Dolan)

Nearly two months after the first alpha release, the release of OCaml 5.2.0 is drawing near.

We have thus released a first beta version of OCaml 5.2.0 to help you update your softwares and libraries ahead of the release (see below for the installation instructions).

Compared to the alpha release, this beta contains a majority of runtime system fixes, and a handful of other fixes across many subsystems.

Overall, the opam ecosystem looks in a good shape for the first beta release.
Most core development tools support OCaml 5.2.0, and you can follow the last remaining wrinkles on the
[opam readiness for 5.2.0 meta-issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/25182).

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Currently, the release is planned for the end of April or the beginning of May.

If you are interested in full list of features and bug fixes of the new OCaml version, the
updated change log for OCaml 5.2.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.2/Changes).

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.2.0~beta1
```

The source code for the alpha is also available at these addresses:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.2.0-beta1.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.2/ocaml-5.2.0~beta1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.2.0~beta1+options <option_list>
```

where `option_list` is a space-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:

```bash
opam switch create 5.2.0~beta1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.2.0~beta1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
