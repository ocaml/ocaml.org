The release of OCaml version 5.0.0 is imminent. As a final step before the
release, we are publishing a release candidate that you can test while waiting
for the release in the upcoming weeks.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Compared to the second beta release, this release contains one toplevel bug fix
and a minor type system fix.

If you are interested by the bug fixes beyond the new Multicore runtime, the
full change log for OCaml 5.0.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.0/Changes)

A short summary of the changes since the second beta release is also available below.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0~rc1
```
For previous version of opam, the switch creation command line is slightly more verbose:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0~rc1 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```
It might be also interesting to check the new support for parallelism by installing the `domainslib` library with
```bash
opam install domainslib
```
The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.0.0-rc1.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.0/ocaml-5.0.0~rc1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.0.0~rc1+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a comma-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.0.0~rc1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.0.0~rc1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

The command line above is slightly more complicated for opam versions before 2.1:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.5.0.0~rc1+options,<option_list> --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```
In both cases, all available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
