  * (*breaking change*) [#10723](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10723): do not use `-flat-namespace` linking for macOS.

  ### Build system:
  
  - [#11590](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11590): Allow installing to a destination path containing spaces.
    (Élie Brami, review by Sébastien Hinderer and David Allsopp)
  
  - [#12372](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12372): Pass option -no-execute-only to the linker for OpenBSD >= 7.3
    so that code sections remain readable, as needed for closure marshaling.

    Sébastien Hinderer)

  - [#12061](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12061), [#12063](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12063): don't add inconsistent equalities when computing
    high-level error messages for functor applications and inclusions.
    (Florian Angeletti, review by Gabriel Scherer)
  
  - [#12878](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12878): fix incorrect treatment of injectivity for private recursive types.
    (Jeremy Yallop, review by Gabriel Scherer and Jacques Garrigue)

    to allow configuration with either pre-Haswell/pre-Piledriver CPUs or running

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Grace Chisholm Young by announcing the release of OCaml version 4.14.2.

This release is a collection of safe bug fixes, cherry-picked from the OCaml 5 branch.
If you are still using OCaml 4.14 and cannot yet upgrade to OCaml 5, this release is for you.

The 4.14 branch is expected to receive updates for at least one year, while the OCaml 5 branch is stabilising.

Thus don't hesitate to report any bugs on the [OCaml issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

See the list of changes below for more details.
