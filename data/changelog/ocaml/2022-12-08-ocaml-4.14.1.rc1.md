The release of OCaml version 4.14.1 is imminent.

This companion release to the OCaml 5.0.0 release will backport many safe bug
fixes from the currently experimental 5.0 branch to the stable 4.14 branch.
A full list of bug fixes is available below.

In order to ensure that the future release works as expected, we are testing
a release candidate during the upcoming weeks.

If you find any bugs, please report them here on [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1:
```
opam update
opam switch create 4.14.1~rc1
```
For previous version of opam, the switch creation command line is slightly more verbose:
```
opam update
opam switch create 4.14.1~rc1 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```
It might be also interesting to check the new support for parallelism by installing the `domainslib` library with
```
opam install domainslib
```
The source code for the release candidate is available on

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.14.1-rc1.tar.gz)
- [Inria archives](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.14/)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.4.14.1~rc1+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a comma-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 4.14.1~rc1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.4.14.1~rc1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```
The command line above is slightly more complicated for opam versions before 2.1:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.4.14.1~rc1+options,<option_list> --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```
In both cases, all available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
