  ## Changes Since Last Alpha Release

  ### `Stdlib` Changes

  + [#11309](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11309), [#11424](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11424), [#11427](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11427), +[#11545](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11545): Add Domain.recommended_domain_count.
    (Christiano Haesbaert, Konstantin Belousov, review by David Allsopp,
    KC Sivaramakrishnan, Gabriel Scherer, Nicolas Ojeda Bar)

  - [#11423](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11423): Move the effect exceptions to the Effect module
    (KC Sivaramakrishnan, Xavier Leroy, Florian Angeletti, review by
    Florian Angeletti, Xavier Leroy, and KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  - [#11593](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11593): Remove Domain.at_each_spawn
    (Florian Angeletti, review by Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni
    and KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  ### Bug Fixes

  - [#11303](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11303): Ensure that GC is not invoked from bounds check failures
    (Stephen Dolan, review by Sadiq Jaffer and Xavier Leroy)

  - [#5299](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/5299), [#4787](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/4787), [#11138](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11138), [#11272](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11272), [#11506](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11506): To help debugging, `Caml_state`
    now dynamically checks that the domain lock is held and fails
    otherwise (with a fatal error at most entry points of the C API, or
    systematically in debug mode). A new variable `Caml_state_opt` is
    introduced and is `NULL` when the domain lock is not held. This
    allows to test from C code if the current thread holds its domain lock.
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Florian Angeletti, Damien
    Doligez, Sadiq Jaffer, Xavier Leroy, and Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11223](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11223): The serialisation format of custom blocks changed in 4.08,
    but the deserialiser would still support the pre-4.08 format.  OCaml
    5.x removed support for this old format and provided a clear error message
    in this case.
    (Hugo Heuzard, review by Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11504](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11504), [#11522](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11522): Use static allocation for `caml_make_float_vect` in
    no-flat-float-array mode, it's more efficient and avoids a race condition
    (Xavier Leroy, report by Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by David Allsopp)

  - [#11461](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11461), [#11466](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11466): Fix `gethostbyaddr` for IPv6 arguments and make it domain-safe
    (Olivier Nicole, Nicolás Ojeda Bär, David Allsopp and Xavier Leroy,
    review by the same)

  - [#11479](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11479): Make Unix.symlink domain-safe on Windows
    (Olivier Nicole, review by Xavier Leroy and David Allsopp)

  - [#11294](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11294): Switch minimum required autoconf to 2.71.
    (David Allsopp, review by Xavier Leroy)

  - [#11370](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11370), [#11373](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11373): Don't pass CFLAGS to flexlink during configure.
    (David Allsopp, report by William Hu, review by Xavier Leroy and
    Sébastien Hinderer)

    Xavier Leroy)

  - [#11508](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11508), [#11509](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11509): make Bytes.escaped domain-safe
    (Christiano Haesbaert and Gabriel Scherer,
    review by Xavier Leroy,
    report by Jan Midtgaard and Tom Kelly)

  - [#11516](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11516), [#11524](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11524): Fix the `deprecated_mutable` attribute.
    (Chris Casinghino, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär and Florian Angeletti)

The release of OCaml 5.0.0 is drawing near.
The standard library has been stabilized and many opam packages already
work with this release.
After two alpha releases,  we have released the first beta version to help you update your software and libraries ahead of the release (see below for the installation instructions).

If you find any bugs, please report them [on GitHub issues](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Compared to the last alpha release, this beta contains many small, internal
runtime fixes (in particular in the `systhreads` library).

At the user level, the interface of the Domain and Effect module has been tweaked to be (hopefully) more forward-compatible:

- Exceptions related to effects are now defined in the Effecŧ module.
- The value `Domain.recommended_domain_count` is no longer a constant and the function `Domain.at_each_spawn` has been removed.

With those changes, the standard library should be stable now.

If you are interested in the ongoing list of bug fixes, the
updated change log for OCaml 5.0.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.0/Changes).

You can also follow the state of the opam ecosystem on [this `opam-repository` issues](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/21526), and at [check.ocamllabs.io](http://check.ocamllabs.io/)

A short summary of the changes since the last alpha release is also available
below.


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0~beta1
```

For previous versions of opam, the switch creation command line is slightly more verbose:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0~beta1 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```

It might also be interesting to check the new support for parallelism by installing
the `domainslib` library with

```bash
opam install domainslib
```

The source code for the beta release is also available at these addresses:

* [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.0.0-beta1.tar.gz](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.0.0-beta1.tar.gz)
* [https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.0/ocaml-5.0.0~beta1.tar.gz](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.0/ocaml-5.0.0~beta1.tar.gz)

## Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta1+options <option_list>
```
where `option_list` is a comma-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.0.0~beta1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```
The command line above is slightly more complicated for opam versions before 2.1:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta1+options,<option_list> --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```

In both cases, all available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.

## Optional opam Alpha Repository

During the beta release, if your dependencies are not yet compatible with OCaml 5.0.0, 
you might want to check the alpha opam repository: [https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository).

Which can be installed with
```bash
opam repo add alpha git+https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository.git
```
You can check that the alpha repository has been correctly installed with
```bash
$ opam repo
<><> Repository configuration for switch 5.0.0~beta1 <><><><><><><><><><><><><>
 1 alpha   git+https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository.git
 2 default https://opam.ocaml.org
```
This alpha repository contains various fixes that are in the process of being upstreamed,
but it should be less and less required with the progress of the beta release.
