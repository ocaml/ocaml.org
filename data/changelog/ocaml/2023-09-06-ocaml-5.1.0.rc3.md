  ## Last Second Bug Fixes
  - [#11284](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11284), +[#12525](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12525): Use compression of entries scheme when pruning mark stack.
   Can decrease memory usage for some workloads, otherwise should be
   unobservable.
   (Tom Kelly, review by Sabine Schmaltz, Sadiq Jaffer, and Damien Doligez)

  - [#12486](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12486): Fix delivery of unhandled effect exceptions on s390x
  (Miod Vallat, report by Jan Midtgaard, review by Vincent Laviron and Xavier
  Leroy)
---

Since last week, there were two significant bugs fixed in the OCaml 5.1.0 runtime (one overflow bug and a stack corruption bug in the s390x port). Since those bug fixes are as small as they are subtle, they were deemed worthy of a release of a third release candidate for OCaml 5.1.0.

If there are no more surprises this week, the release of OCaml 5.1.0 shall happen next week.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

The full changelog for OCaml 5.1.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.1/Changes)

A short summary of the two fixed bugs in this release candidate is also available below.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc3
```

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.0-rc3.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.1/ocaml-5.1.0~rc3.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc3+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a comma-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc3+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc3+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
