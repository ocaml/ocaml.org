  ## Changes since the first beta

  ### Configuration changes

  - [#11097](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11097): Build native-code
  compilers on NetBSD/aarch64 (Kate Deplaix, review by Anil Madhavapeddy)

  ### Bug fixes

  - [#10875](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10875),
  +[#11731](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11731): Add option to allocate
  fiber stacks and sigaltstacks with mmap(MAP_STACK) instead of malloc. This is
  exposed via a configure –enable-mmap-map-stack option, and is enabled by default

  Gabriel Scherer)
  - [#11669](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11669),
  [#11704](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11704): Fix construction of
  Effect.Unhandled exceptions in the bytecode interpreter. (David Allsopp and

  created / installed libraries (Sébastien Hinderer and Xavier Leroy, review by

  when printing a constructor or record mismatch error involving recursive types.
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Gabriel Scherer)
  - [#11662](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11662),
  [#11673](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11673): fix a memory leak when
  using Dynlink, the bug was only present in development version of OCaml 5.
  (Stephen Dolan, report by Andre Maroneze, review by Gabriel Scherer)
  - [#11732](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11732): Ensure that types from
  packed modules are always generalised (Stephen Dolan and Leo White, review by
  Jacques Garrigue)
  - [#11737](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11737): Fix segfault condition
  in Unix.stat under Windows in the presence of multiple threads. (Marc Lasson,
  Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Gabriel Scherer and David Allsopp)

  ### Documentation

  - [#11193](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11193),
  [#11227](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11227): documentation on
  concurrency safety for mutable data types and states in the standard library. A
  unsynchronized_access alert have been added for functions that require user
  synchronizations on concurrent access. The new alert is diabled by default.
  (Florian Angeletti, review by François Pottier and KC Sivaramakrishnan )
  - [#11526](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11526), add a unstable alert to
  the Domain and Effect modules. The new alert is disabled by default. (Florian
  Angeletti, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Daniel Bünzli, and Kate Deplaix)
  - [#11640](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11640): Add Flambda
  commonly-used options to the ocamlopt manpage (Amandine Nangah, review by David
  Allsopp, Florian Angeletti, Sébastien Hinderer, and Vincent Laviron)

The release of OCaml 5.0.0 is drawing close.

In order to test the most recent bug fixes and to help you update your software
and libraries ahead of the release, we have released a second beta version of
OCaml 5.0.0, (see below for the installation instructions).

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Compared to the first beta release, this second beta contains many small
internal standard library fixes, one configuration fix and many small bug fixes.

We also have few updates of the documentation, which introduce two new alerts:
one for the unstable modules Domain and Effect, and another for functions doing
unsynchronized_access to mutable state in the standard library. Those two alerts
are disabled by default, but are available for interested users.

The first release candidate for OCaml 5.0.0 is expected to follow closely this
second beta release.

If you are interested in the ongoing list of bug fixes, the updated change log
for OCaml 5.0.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.0/Changes).

You can also follow the state of the opam ecosystem on [http://check.ocamllabs.io/](http://check.ocamllabs.io/).

A short summary of the changes since the first beta release is also available below.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0~beta2
```

For previous versions of opam, the switch creation command line is slightly more verbose:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0~beta2 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```

It might also be interesting to check the new support for parallelism by installing
the `domainslib` library with
```bash
opam install domainslib
```

The source code for the beta release is also available at these addresses:

* [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.0.0-beta2.tar.gz](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.0.0-beta2.tar.gz)
* [https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.0/ocaml-5.0.0~beta2.tar.gz](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.0/ocaml-5.0.0~beta2.tar.gz)

## Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta2+options <option_list>
```
where `option_list` is a comma-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.0.0~beta2+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta2+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```
The command line above is slightly more complicated for opam versions before 2.1:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta2+options,<option_list> --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```

In both cases, all available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
