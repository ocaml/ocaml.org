After two alpha releases, the release of OCaml 5.1.0 is drawing near.
We have thus released a first beta version of OCaml 5.1.0 to help you update your softwares and libraries ahead of the release (see below for the installation instructions).
Compared to the last alpha release, this beta contains two subtle internal runtime fixes and one Windows fix.
Overall, the opam ecosystem looks in a good shape for the first beta release.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Nearly all core development tools support OCaml 5.1.0, and you can follow the last remaining wrinkles on the
[opam readiness for 5.1.0 meta-issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/23669).

Currently, the release is planned for the end of July or the beginning of August.

If you are interested in full list of features and bug fixes of the new OCaml version, the
updated change log for OCaml 5.1.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.1/Changes).

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0~beta1
```

The source code for the alpha is also available at these addresses:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.0-beta1.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.1/ocaml-5.1.0~beta1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.1.0~beta1+options <option_list>
```

where `option_list` is a space-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:

```bash
opam switch create 5.1.0~beta1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0~beta1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
