The release of OCaml version 4.14.2 is imminent.

OCaml 4.14.2 is a new update to the stable 4.14 branch of OCaml. This new
release backports many safe bug fixes from the OCaml 5 branch and fixes
a handful of compatibility issues of OCaml 4.14.1 with newer operating system versions.

A full list of bug fixes is available below.

In order to ensure that the future release works as expected, we are planning to test a release candidate during the upcoming week.

If you find any bugs, please report them here on [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1:
```
opam update
opam switch create 4.14.2~rc1
```


The source code for the release candidate is available on

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.14.2-rc1.tar.gz)
- [Inria archives](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.14/ocaml-4.14.2-rc1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.4.14.2~rc1+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a space-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 4.14.2~rc1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.4.14.2~rc1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
