The release of OCaml 5.2.0 is imminent.
As a final step, we are publishing a release candidate to check that everything is in order before the release in the upcoming week(s).

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Compared to the second beta, this release contains one small compiler-libs printer fix and one configuration tweak.

The full change log for OCaml 5.2.0 is available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.2/Changes). A short summary of the
changes since the second beta release is also available below.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.2.0~rc1
```

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.2.0-rc1.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.2/ocaml-5.2.0~rc1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.2.0~rc1+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a space-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.2.0~rc1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.2.0~rc1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
