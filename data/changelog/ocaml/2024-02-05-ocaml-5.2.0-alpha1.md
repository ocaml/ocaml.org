title: OCaml 5.2.0 - First Alpha
description: First Alpha Release of OCaml 5.2.0

Two months after the release of OCaml 5.1.1, the set of new features for the
future version 5.2.0 of OCaml has been frozen. We are thus happy to announce the
first alpha release for OCaml 5.2.0.

This alpha version is here to help fellow hackers join us early in our bug
hunting and opam ecosystem fixing fun (see below for the installation instructions).

The progresses on stabilising the ecosystem are tracked on the
[opam readiness for 5.2.0 meta-issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/25182).
The full release is expected around April.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

If you are interested in the ongoing list of new features and bug fixes, the
updated change log for OCaml 5.2.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.2/Changes).

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1 and later:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.2.0~alpha1
```

For previous version of opam, the switch creation command line is slightly more verbose:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.2.0~alpha1 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```

The source code for the alpha is also available at these addresses:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.2.0-alpha1.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.2/ocaml-5.2.0~alpha1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.2.0~alpha1+options <option_list>
```

where `option_list` is a space separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a flambda and no-flat-float-array switch:

```bash
opam switch create 5.2.0~alpha1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.2.0~alpha1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

The command line above is slightly more complicated for opam version anterior to 2.1:


```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.5.2.0~alpha1+options,<option_list> --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
```
In both cases, all available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
