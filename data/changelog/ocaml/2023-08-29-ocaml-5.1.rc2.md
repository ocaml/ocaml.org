  ## Last Minute Bug Fixes

   ### Type System:
 
  * (*breaking change*) [#6941](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/6941), [#11187](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11187), +[#12483](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12483): prohibit using classes through recursive modules
   inheriting or including a class belonging to a mutually-recursive module
   would previous behave incorrectly, and now results in a clean error.
   (Leo White, review by Gabriel Scherer and Florian Angeletti)

  ### Runtime

  - [#12481](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12481), [#12505](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12505): Fix incorrect initialization of array expressions
  `[|e1;...;eN|]` when `N` is large enough to require major heap allocation.

   and Vincent Laviron, review by Gabriel Scherer)

---
In the last two weeks, two significant bugs have been discovered in the release candidate for OCaml 5.1.0 (one affecting the type system, another in the runtime).

Those bugs are now fixed and we are publishing a second release candidate to check that everything is in order before the release in the upcoming week.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

The full changelog for OCaml 5.1.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.1/Changes).
A short summary of the two fixed bugs in this release candidate is also available below.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc2
```

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.0-rc2.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.1/ocaml-5.1.0~rc2.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc2+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a comma-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc2+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc2+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
