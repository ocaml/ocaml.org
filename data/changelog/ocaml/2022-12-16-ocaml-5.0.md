  ## OCaml 5.0.0 (16 December 2022)

  - [#10831](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10831): Multicore OCaml
    (Enguerrand Decorne, Stephen Dolan, Tom Kelly, Sadiq Jaffer,
    Anil Madhavapeddy, Sudha Parimala, KC Sivaramakrishnan,
    Leo White, the Tarides multicore team,
    review by Florian Angeletti, Damien Doligez, Xavier Leroy,
    Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, Olivier Nicole, Nicolás Ojeda Bär,
    Gabriel Scherer, the OCaml core development team, and many
    other valued reviewers.)

  ### Runtime system:

  - [#11400](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11400): Runtime events counters fixes
    Fixes mismatch between OCaml and C APIs, removes events from 4.x that
    are not present in the 5.0 GC and adds some missing probes.
    (Sadiq Jaffer, review by Gabriel Scherer, Florian Angeletti)

  - [#11368](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11368): Runtime events buffer size OCAMLRUNPARAMS fix
    The runtime events buffer size can now be set via the 'e' OCAMLRUNPARAM.
    This is previously mistakenly enabled/disabled tracing instead.
    (Sadiq Jaffer, review by KC Sivaramakrishnan, David Allsopp, Damien Doligez)

  - [#11308](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11308): Add environment variable to preserve runtime_events after exit
    If the environment variable OCAML_RUNTIME_EVENTS_PRESERVE exists then the
    runtime will not remove the runtime events ring buffers at exit. This
    makes tracing very short running programs more reliable.
    (Sadiq Jaffer, review by KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  - [#10964](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10964): Ring-buffer based runtime tracing (runtime_events)
    Runtime_events is a very low overhead runtime tracing system designed for
    continuous monitoring of OCaml applications.
    (Sadiq Jaffer, review by Anil Madhavapeddy, Enguerrand Decorne,
    Richard Warburton, Gabriel Scherer, Sabine Schmaltz, Florian Angeletti,
    Patrick Ferris, Tom Kelly)

  * (*breaking change*) [#10723](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10723): do not use `-flat-namespace` linking for macOS.
    (Carlo Cabrera, review by Damien Doligez)

  * (*breaking change*) [#10863](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10863), [#10933](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10933): Remove support for old, unprefixed C runtime function names
    such as `alloc`.  The new names prefixed with `caml_` must be used instead,
    such as `caml_alloc`.  Consequently, it is no longer needed to define
    `CAML_NAME_SPACE` to avoid bringing unprefixed names into scope: this is now
    the default behavior.
    (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Xavier Leroy)

  - [#10902](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10902): Do not register empty code fragments in natdynlink.
    (David Allsopp, review by Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez)

  - [#10965](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10965): `caml_fatal_error_hook`, GC timing hooks, and
    `caml_scan_roots_hook` are now atomic variables. Restore GC timing
    hooks in multicore.
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Enguerrand Decorne, Xavier
    Leroy, Gabriel Scherer, and KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  - [#11209](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11209): Add a public and thread-safe timing hook running at domain
    termination, after this domain has stopped running any OCaml code:
    `caml_domain_terminated_hook`. This can be useful for implementing
    domain-local state in C.
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Xavier Leroy and Gabriel
    Scherer)

  - [#10875](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10875), [#11731](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11731): Add option to allocate fiber stacks and sigaltstacks with
    mmap(MAP_STACK) instead of malloc. This is exposed via a configure
    --enable-mmap-map-stack option, and is enabled by default on OpenBSD where
    it is mandatory.
    (Anil Madhavapeddy, review by Gabriel Scherer, Tom Kelly,
    Michael Hendricks and KC Sivaramakrishnan).

  - [#10950](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10950): Do not use mmap to allocate Caml_state.
    In order to reduce virtual memory usage, we dynamically allocate
    the domain_state structure.
    (Enguerrand Decorne, KC Sivaramakrishnan and Tom Kelly,
    review by Anil Madhavapeddy and Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11010](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11010): Use strerror_r for reentrant error string conversion.
    (Anil Madhavapeddy and Xavier Leroy, review by same and Edwin Török)

  - [#11002](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11002), [#11066](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11066), [#11086](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11086): Do not use Begin_roots/End_roots macros in
    the runtime system.  Also fix a missing root registration in the
    implementation of Unix.write on Windows.
    (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Daniel Bünzli and Antonin Décimo,
    review by Xavier Leroy and David Allsopp)

  - [#11022](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11022): Track GC work for all managed bigarray allocations
    (Stephen Dolan, report by Andrew Hunter, review by Damien Doligez)

  - [#10802](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10802): Use 4.12 value macros and helpers in C code
    (Antonin Décimo, review by Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11105](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11105): Fix handling of fiber stack cache with multiple domains
    (Jon Ludlam, KC Sivaramakrishnan and Tom Kelly)

  - [#11054](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11054): Respect user provided maximum stack space
    Make sure the stack we initially request is sized accordingly to
    the user provided settings. tmc/stack_space is also updated by
    this PR in order to account for this change.
    (Enguerrand Decorne, report by Jon Ludlam,
    review by Tom Kelly, KC Sivaramakrishnan and Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11238](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11238): Increase the default limit for the stack size to 128 Mi words,
    i.e. 1 Gib for 64-bit platforms and 512 Mib for 32-bit platforms.
    (Xavier Leroy, review by Sébastien Hinderer)

  * (*breaking change*) [#11295](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11295): An ISO C 2011 compliant compiler, including full support for atomic
    types, is now required to build the OCaml runtime system.
    (Xavier Leroy, review by David Allsopp and Sébastien Hinderer)

  - [#10915](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10915), [#11039](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11039), [#11057](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11057), [#11095](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11095), [#11190](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11190): Implement quality treatment for
    asynchronous actions in multicore. Reimplement the old behaviour of
    `caml_process_pending*` for multicore.
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Sadiq Jaffer and Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11303](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11303): Ensure that GC is not invoked from bounds check failures
    (Stephen Dolan, review by Sadiq Jaffer and Xavier Leroy)

  - [#11304](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11304): Fix data race on Windows file descriptors
    (Olivier Nicole and Xavier Leroy, review by Xavier Leroy, David Allsopp,
    and Sadiq Jaffer)

  * (*breaking change*) [#11337](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11337): pass 'flags' metadata to root scanners, to optimize stack
    scanning in the bytecode interpreter.
    Changes the interface of user-provided root-scanning hooks.
    (Gabriel Scherer, review by Xavier Leroy,
    Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, Sadiq Jaffer and Tom Kelly)

  - [#11144](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11144): Restore frame-pointers support for amd64
    (Fabrice Buoro, review by Frederic Bour and KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  * (*breaking change*) [#11255](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11255): in the C interface, `&Field(v, i)` now has type `volatile value *`
    instead of `value *` in OCaml 4.  This makes the memory model
    for mixed OCaml/C code better defined, but can cause warnings or type
    errors in user C code.
    (KC Sivaramakrishnan, review by Xavier Leroy, Gabriel Scherer and
    Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, additional discussions with Stephen
    Dolan and Luc Maranget)

  - [#5299](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/5299), [#4787](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/4787), [#11138](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11138), [#11272](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11272), [#11506](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11506): To help debugging, `Caml_state`
    now dynamically checks that the domain lock is held, and fails
    otherwise (with a fatal error at most entry points of the C API, or
    systematically in debug mode). A new variable `Caml_state_opt` is
    introduced, and is `NULL` when the domain lock is not held. This
    allows to test from C code if the current thread holds the lock of
    its domain.
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Florian Angeletti, Damien
    Doligez, Sadiq Jaffer, Xavier Leroy, and Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11223](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11223): The serialization format of custom blocks changed in 4.08,
    but the deserializer would still support the pre-4.08 format.  OCaml
    5.x removed support for this old format; provide a clear error message
    in this case.
    (Hugo Heuzard, review by Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11504](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11504), [#11522](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11522): Use static allocation in `caml_make_float_vect` in
    no-flat-float-array mode, it's more efficient and avoids a a race condition
    (Xavier Leroy, report by Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by David Allsopp)

  - [#11652](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11652): Fix benign off-by-one error in Windows implementation of caml_mem_map.
    (David Allsopp, review by Gabriel Scherer)

  - [#11669](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11669), [#11704](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11704): Fix construction of Effect.Unhandled exceptions in the

    Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, Eduardo Rafael, Stephen Dolan and
    Gabriel Scherer)

  * (*breaking change*) [#10845](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10845) Emit frametable size on amd64 BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD) systems
    (emitted for Linux in [#8805](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8805))

    Thread.wait_write, Thread.wait_read, the whole ThreadUnix module, the
    infix operator (.[]<-).
    (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Damien Doligez)

  * (*breaking change*) [#10896](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10896): Remove Stream, Genlex and Pervasives. Also remove legacy standalone
    bigarray library (the Bigarray module is now part of the standard library).
    (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Kate Deplaix and Anil Madhavapeddy)

    exception `Thread.Exit`, and mark `Thread.exit` as deprecated.
    The new implementation changes the behavior compared with
    the OCaml 4 implementation.  For example, the new implementation
    causes `Fun.finally` finalizers to be run and catch-all exception
    handlers to prevent termination.
    (Jacques-Henri Jourdan and Xavier Leroy, review by Damien Doligez,
    Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, Gabriel Scherer, and Enguerrand Decorne)

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthdays of Jane Austen and Arthur C. Clarke by
announcing the release of OCaml version 5.0.0.

The highlight of this new major version of OCaml is the long-awaited runtime support
for [shared memory parallelism](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/parallelism.html) and [effect handlers](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/effects.html).

This multicore support is the culmination of more than 8 years of effort,
and required a full rewrite of the OCaml runtime environment.
Consequently, OCaml 5.0.0 is expected to be a more experimental version of
OCaml than the usual OCaml releases.

In this release, the native compiler only supports the x86-64 and arm64 architectures. In terms of operating systems, Linux, the BSDs, macOS and mingw64 on Windows
are supported.

We are planning to restore the support for most previously supported architectures and operating systems, and address remaining known issues over the course of the next year.

Don't let those words of caution hinder your experimentation with OCaml 5:
OCaml 5 as a language is fully compatible with OCaml 4 down to the performance
characteristics of your programs. In other words, any code that works with OCaml 4 should work the same with OCaml 5. 

The currently known exceptions to this rule are:
- the removal of many long-deprecated functions and modules
- changes to the internal runtime API
- the performance of ephemerons is currently (and temporarily) strongly degraded.

Please report any unexpected behaviours on the [OCaml issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues)
and post any questions or comments you might have on our
[discussion forums](https://discuss.ocaml.org).


During the maturing period for OCaml 5, the OCaml 4.14 branch will be maintained
by backporting bug fixes from the OCaml 5 branch at regular intervals.
The next release on the OCaml 4.14 branch, OCaml 4.14.1, should soon follow this release.

The full list of changes can be found in the changelog below.

---

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0
```

It might be also interesting to check the new support for parallelism by installing the `domainslib` library with
```bash
opam install domainslib
```
The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.0.0.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.0/ocaml-5.0.0.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a comma-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.0.0+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

The command line above is slightly more complicated for opam versions before 2.1:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options,<option_list>
```
In both cases, all available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
