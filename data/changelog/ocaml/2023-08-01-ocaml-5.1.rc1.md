  ## Changes Since the Beta
  
  ### Bug Fix
  
  - [#12445](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12445): missing GC root registrations in `runtime/io.c`
    (Gabriel Scherer, review by Xavier Leroy and Jeremy Yallop)
  
  ### Configuration Fix (openBSD)
  
  - [#12372](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12372): Pass option `-no-execute-only` to the linker for OpenBSD >= 7.3
    so that code sections remain readable, as needed for closure marshaling.
    (Xavier Leroy and Anil Madhavapeddy, review by Anil Madhavapeddy and
    Sébastien Hinderer)
  
  ### Tool Fix (ocamlmktop)
  
  * [#11745](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11745), [#12358](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12358): Debugger and toplevels: embed printer types rather than
    reading their representations from `topdirs.cmi` at runtime.
    This change also removes the ocamlmktop initialisation module introduced
    in [#11382](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11382) which was no longer useful.
    This change breaks toplevel scripts relying on the visibility of `Topdirs`
    in the initial toplevel environment without loading `topfind`.
    Since the opam default `.ocamlinit` file loads `topfind`, it is expected
    that only scripts run with `ocaml -noinit` are affected.
    For those scripts, accessing `Topdirs` now requires the `compiler-libs`
    directory to be added to the toplevel search path with
    ```
      #directory "+compiler-libs";;
    ```
   as was already the case for the other modules in the toplevel interface
   library.

   Gabriel Scherer)
  
  ### Documentation Changes
  
  
  - [#12201](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12201): in the tutorial on modules, replace priority queue example by
    a simpler example based on FIFO queues.
    (Xavier Leroy, review by Anil Madhavapeddy and Nicolás Ojeda Bär).
  
  - [#12352](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12352): Fix a typo in the documentation of Arg.write_arg
    (Christophe Raffalli, review by Florian Angeletti)

The release of OCaml 5.1.0 is imminent.
As a final step, we are publishing a release candidate to check that everything is in order before the release in the upcoming week(s).

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Compared to the beta release, this release contains one safe runtime fix and two configuration tweaks.

The full change log for OCaml 5.1.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.1/Changes)
A short summary of the changes since the beta release is also available below.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc1
```

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.0-rc1.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.1/ocaml-5.1.0~rc1.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc1+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a comma-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
