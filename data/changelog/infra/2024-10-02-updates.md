[Tarides'](https://tarides.com/) OCaml Infrastructure team has been hard at work
over the last few months, focusing on improving the stability, reliability, and
user experience of the OCaml ecosystem's core infrastructure. We are preparing
for more substantive changes to come. We will have more fruit from this work to
share soon, but updates on our efforts are overdue and we wanted to get you all
caught up.

## Platform Support

We've expanded and updated our platform support to keep pace with the evolving OCaml ecosystem:

- As part of the compiler release readiness, we've added support for OCaml 5.2
  and the upcoming 5.3, currently in alpha.
- We're now publishing Windows Server 2022 Docker images to the OCaml Dockerhub.
  See for instance
  [windows-server-msvc-ltsc2022-ocaml-4.14](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ocaml/opam/windows-server-msvc-ltsc2022-ocaml-4.14/images/sha256-cfe98cb048514e9eace3c4d4e607b7e7fce5abba3a49e9a07318180d6213eee2?context=explore)
- Dropped support for the post-LTS distro versions Debian 10 and 11, focusing
  our resources on the OCaml compiler's Tier 1 platform.

These updates ensure that our systems continue to support OCaml developers on a
broad range of systems, in particular by testing package publication to the opam
repository and publishing Docker images.

## Opam Repository Publishing Experience

We've made improvements to enhance the experience of publishing packages to the
opam repository:

- Implemented a linting check for package maintainer email addresses,
  ensuring package maintainers can be reliably contacted when needed.
- Mitigated solver timeout errors in the opam repo CI system, reducing
  frustrating delays in the package publishing process.
- Fixed an uncaught exception that sometimes occurred during linting checks in
  the opam repo CI.
- Improved error reporting and added instructions for running lint checks
  locally, making it easier for package authors to identify and resolve issues
  before submitting to the repository.
- We are [generating documentation of the platforms under test in opam
  CI][platforms], allowing package others a clear overview of the extensive
  build matrix we are providing.

We hope these changes will make package publication experience smoother. We're
committed to improving the experience for newcomers and existing repository
contributors alike, stay tuned for more improvements!

## Security and Reliability

Maintaining the security and reliability of the OCaml infrastructure remains a
top priority:

- Updated our systems to address
  [CVE-2024-6387](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6387).
- We maintained 99.9% availability for the opam repo CI over the last two
  months, providing a stable and reliable service for the OCaml community.
