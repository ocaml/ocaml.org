There is an electrical shutdown for essential maintenance this weekend, which will affect large parts of the cluster.  All Power9, ARM64, RISC-V, Windows and FreeBSD workers and docs.ci.ocaml.org, docs-data.ocaml.org and the benchmarking servers will be unavailable.  x86_64 workers will be substantially reduced.  Service is expected to resume late on Sunday evening.
