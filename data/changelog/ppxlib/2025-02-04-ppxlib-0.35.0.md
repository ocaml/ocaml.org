title: Ppxlib 0.35.0
tags: [ppxlib, platform]
changelog: |

  - Allow use of effect syntax in preprocessed files without causing migration
  failures. (#552, @hhugo, @NathanReb)

  - Remove support for compilers older than 4.08 (#556, @NathanReb)

  - Add a `--use-compiler-pp` flag to the standalone driver. This flag
  can be set when the driver outputs source code to make it use the compiler's
  `Pprintast` instead of ppxlib's.

We are happy to announce the release of ppxlib.0.35.0!

The main feature of this release is improved support for OCaml 5.3, allowing ppx users to have ppx rewriters operate on files with the new effect syntax.

Note that ppx-es and the effect syntax can cohabit but it is possible that ppx rewriters will error out if they encounter effect syntax node in their extension's payload or in the items they generate code from.

This feature also comes with a new `--use-compiler-pp` driver flag. This flag is required to preserve the effect syntax when the ppxlib driver outputs source code instead of marshalled AST. Note that the vast majority of users won't need to use this flag but it can come in handy in some more advanced use cases.
