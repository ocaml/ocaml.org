date: "2021-12-10"
tags: [ppxlib]
changelog: |
  - Add support for OCaml 4.14 (#304, @kit-ty-kate)
  - Expand nodes before applying derivers or other inline attributes based
    transformation, allowing better interactions between extensions and
    derivers (#279, #297, @NathanReb)
  - Add support for registering ppx_import as a pseudo context-free rule (#271, @NathanReb)
  - Add `input_name` to the `Expansion_context.Extension` and `Expansion_context.Deriver` modules (#284, @tatchi)
  - Improve `gen_symbol` to strip previous unique suffix before adding a new one (#285, @ceastlund)
  - Improve `name_type_params_in_td` to use prefixes `a`, `b`, ... instead of `v_x`. (#285, @ceastlund)
  - Fix a bug in `type_is_recursive` and `really_recursive` where they would
    consider a type declaration recursive if the type appeared inside an attribute
    payload (#299, @NathanReb)
