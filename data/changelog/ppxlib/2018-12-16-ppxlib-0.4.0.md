The ppxlib team is pleased to announce the release of
[ppxlib](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib) 0.4.0. This release adds better
support for defining compile-time interpretation of dotted operators such as
`+.+` and also improves integration with other tools such as reason or metaocaml
by no longer complaining about attributes generated by these tools. In
particular, ppxlib now treats all attributes whose name start with an `_` as
machine generated attributes and doesn’t complain if it can’t decide whether
they have been correctly interpreted or not. FTR, ppxlib tries to detect
attributes and extension points that are dead-code, in order to catch typing
mistakes or misplacement.
