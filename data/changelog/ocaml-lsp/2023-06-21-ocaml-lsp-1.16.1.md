title: Ocaml-lsp 1.16.1
date: "2023-06-21"
tags: [ocaml-lsp, platform]
changelog: |
  ## Features

  - Add "Remove type annotation" code action. ([#1039](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1039))
  - Support settings through `didChangeConfiguration` notification ([#1103](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1103))
  - Add "Extract local" and "Extract function" code actions. ([#870](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/870))
  - Depend directly on `merlin-lib` 4.9 ([#1070](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1070))

  ## Fixes

  - Support building with OCaml 5.0 and 5.1 ([#1150](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1150))
  - Disable code lens by default. The support can be re-enabled by explicitly
    setting it in the configuration. ([#1134](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1134))
  - Fix initilization of `ocamlformat-rpc` in some edge cases when ocamlformat is
    initialized concurrently ([#1132](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1132))
  - Kill unnecessary `$ dune ocaml-merlin` with SIGTERM rather than SIGKILL
    ([#1124](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1124))
  - Refactor comment parsing to use `odoc-parser` and `cmarkit` instead of
    `octavius` and `omd` ([#1088](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1088))

    This allows users who migrated to omd 2.X to install ocaml-lsp-server in the
    same opam switch.

    We also slightly improved markdown generation support and fixed a couple in
    the generation of inline heading and module types.
  - Allow opening documents that were already open. This is a workaround for
    neovim's lsp client ([#1067](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1067))
  - Disable type annotation for functions ([#1054](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1054))
  - Respect codeActionLiteralSupport capability ([#1046](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1046))
  - Fix a document syncing issue when utf-16 is the position encoding ([#1004](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1004))
  - Disable "Type-annotate" action for code that is already annotated.
    ([#1037](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1037), fixes
    [#1036](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/issues/1036))
  - Fix semantic highlighting of long identifiers when using preprocessors
    ([#1049](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1049), fixes
    [#1034](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/issues/1034))
  - Fix the type of DocumentSelector in cram document registration ([#1068](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1068))
  - Accept the `--clientProcessId` command line argument. ([#1074](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1074))
  - Accept `--port` as a synonym for `--socket`. ([#1075](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1075))
  - Fix connecting to dune rpc on Windows. ([#1080](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1080))

We're thrilled to announce the release of OCaml LSP 1.16.1! ðŸŽ‰

This release comes with new "Extract local" and "Extract function" code actions
to easily refactor your code.

We've also disabled code lenses by default following user feedback. You can
follow the discussion
[on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1134).

This release is also the first OCaml LSP release to use upstream Merlin. Among
other things, this means that it is compatible with all the OCaml versions
supported by Merlin: currently OCaml 4.14 and 5.0.0.

We're also releasing numerous bug fixes, including:

- A fix to the integration with Dune RPC on Windows, which, alongside Dune
  3.9.0, makes OCaml LSP report Dune errors to the editors with Dune watch mode
  enabled.
- Minor improvements to the Odoc <-> Markdown conversion to return better
  function documentation on the editor.

And much more! Read the full changelog for a complete list of improvements and
bug fixes.
