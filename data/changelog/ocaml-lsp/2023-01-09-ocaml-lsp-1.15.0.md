changelog: |
  ## Features

  - Enable [semantic highlighting](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_semanticTokens) support by default (#933)

  - Support connecting over pipes and socket. Pipes on Windows aren't yet supported (#946)

    [More](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#implementationConsiderations) about communication channels in LSP specification.

  - Re-enable `ocamlformat-rpc` for formatting code snippets (but not files and
    not on Windows) (#920, #939)

    One needs to have installed either `ocamlformat` package version > 0.21.0 or,
    otherwise, `ocamlformat-rpc` package. Note that previously `ocamlformat-rpc`
    came in a standalone OPAM package, but since `ocamlformat` version > 0.21.0,
    it comes within `ocamlformat` package.

  - Add custom [`ocamllsp/hoverExtended`](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/blob/e165f6a3962c356adc7364b9ca71788e93489dd0/ocaml-lsp-server/docs/ocamllsp/hoverExtended-spec.md#L1) request (#561)

  - Support utf-8 position encoding clients (#919)

    [More](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#position) about position encoding in LSP specification.

  - Show unwrapped module alias types on hovering over module names. This is due
    to upgrading to merlin 4.7 and using merlin's `verbosity=smart` by default
    (#942)

  ## Fixes

  - Respect the client's completion item resolve and preSelect capabilities
    (#925, #936)

  - Disable polling for dune's watch mode on Windows and OCaml 4.14.0 (#935)

  - Fix semantic highlighting of "long identifiers," e.g., `Foo.Bar.x` (#932)

  - Fix syncing of document contents:

    - For ranges that span an entire line (#927)
    - Previously, whole line edits would incorrectly eat the newline characters (#971)

On behalf of the ocaml-lsp team, Iâ€™m pleased to announce ocaml-lsp-server versions `1.15.0-4.14` and `1.15.0-5.0` for OCaml 4.14 and 5.0, respectively. This is the first time we release ocaml-lsp supporting two compiler versions. We look forward to your feedback.
