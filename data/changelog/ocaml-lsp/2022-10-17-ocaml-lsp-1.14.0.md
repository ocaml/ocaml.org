  ## Features

  - Code action for inlining let bindings within a module or expression. (#847)

  - Tag "unused code" and "deprecated" warnings, allowing clients to better
    display them. (#848)

  - Refresh merlin configuration after every dune build in watch mode (#853)

  ## Fixes

  - Respect `showDocument` capabilities. Do not offer commands or code actions
    that rely on this request without client support. (#836)
