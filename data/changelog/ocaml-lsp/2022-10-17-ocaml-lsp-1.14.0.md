tags: [ocaml-lsp, platform]
changelog: |
  ## Features

  - Code action for inlining let bindings within a module or expression. (#847)

    display them. (#848)

  - Refresh merlin configuration after every dune build in watch mode (#853)

  ## Fixes

    that rely on this request without client support. (#836)
