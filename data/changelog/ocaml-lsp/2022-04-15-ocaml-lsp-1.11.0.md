On behalf of the ocamllsp team, I’m excited to announce the availability of version 1.11.0. This release is an important milestone for the project because it introduces integration with our favorite build system. When you run dune in watch mode, you will now be able to see build errors in the diagnostics panel of your editor. It’s all rather experimental for now, so your feedback and bug reports are appreciated.

As usual, the full change log is below.

Happy hacking.
