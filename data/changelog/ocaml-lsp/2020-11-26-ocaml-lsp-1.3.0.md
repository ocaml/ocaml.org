On behalf of the ocaml-lsp team, I’d like to announce version 1.3.0.

This release an improvement in keyword completion and a new code action. Keywords are now filtered by the context the user requested the completion, and there’s a new code action to quickly populate .mli files with the the inferred types from the .ml file.
