On behalf of the ocaml-lsp team, it is my pleasure to announce version 1.4.0. This release introduces support for [automatic signature help](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features#help-with-function-and-method-signatures). Signature help is not yet present in all possible contexts. We intend to improve to support as many relevant language constructs as possible in the future. Many thanks to @mnxn for implementing this feature.

The full change log is replicated at the end of this post for your convenience.

Happy Holidays!
