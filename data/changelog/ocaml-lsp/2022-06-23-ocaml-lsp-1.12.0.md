changelog: |
  ## Features

  - Fix cancellation mechanism for all requests (#707)

  - Allow cancellation of formatting requests (#707)

  - Add `--fallback-read-dot-merlin` to the LSP Server (#705). If `ocamllsp` is
    started with this new flag, it will fall back to looking for Merlin
    configuration in `.merlin` files rather than calling `dune ocaml-merlin`.
    (#705)

  - Support folding more ranges (#692)
