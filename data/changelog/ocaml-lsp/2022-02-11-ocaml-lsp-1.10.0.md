On behalf of the ocamllsp team, Iâ€™m pleased to announce version 1.10.0. The only new feature this release offers is better code folding, but there are some important bug fixes and performance improvements. If you encounter any sluggishness with our server, do not hesitate to report it.

Unless there are serious bugs with this release, this will be the last release for OCaml 4.13.

Happy Hacking.
