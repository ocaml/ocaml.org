  ## Fixes

  - Switch `verbosity` from 1 to 0. This is the same default that merlin uses.
    The old value for verbosity (#433)

  - Get fresh diagnostics (warning and error messages) on a file save (#438)

    Note: If you want the fresh diagnostics to take into account changes in other
    files, you likely need to rebuild your project. An easy way to get automatic
    rebuilds is to run `dune` in a watching mode, e.g.,[dune build --watch].
