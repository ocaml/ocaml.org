On behalf of the ocaml-lsp team, Iâ€™d like to announce version 1.2.0.

This version contains many bug fixes and some performance improvements A couple of interesting features made it in as well:

- Auto-completion of OCaml keywords (not available for reason)
- The ability to jump to the declaration of a value in the .mli.
