Hot on the heels of the OCaml 4.13 announcement(s!), the `odoc` team is pleased to announce the release of `odoc 2.0.0`!

*tl;dr:*
The new version produces [much better output](https://web.archive.org/web/20230602055728/https://ocaml-doc.github.io/odoc-examples/core_kernel/Core_kernel/Bigbuffer/index.html) than [the old version](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206000203/https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/core_kernel/Core_kernel/Bigbuffer/index.html), it's the engine at the core of the package docs in [v3.ocaml.org](https://v3.ocaml.org/packages), and it also has a [new website](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc).

This release has been a long time coming -- years! -- and contains several notable improvements over the `odoc 1.5` series: a new language model, a new rendering layer allowing output in several formats, and improved control over the output structure.

## New Features

### New Language Model

The internal library used by `odoc` that models the OCaml module system has been completely rewritten over a multi-year effort by @jonludlam and @Julow, according to a design by @lpw25. The rewrite gives `odoc` a much better understanding of the module system compared to the original implementation. This library is used for two main processes:

1. To perform _expansions_, which is the process where `odoc` takes complex module type expressions like [this one from tyxml](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208100141/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/deps/tyxml/Html_f/index.html#module-Make):
```ocaml=
module Make
    (Xml : Xml_sigs.T with type ('a, 'b) W.ft = 'a -> 'b)
    (Svg : Svg_sigs.T with module Xml := Xml)
  : Html_sigs.Make(Xml)(Svg).T
    with type +'a elt = Xml.elt
     and type +'a attrib = Xml.attrib
```
Then turns it into an [output page](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208100141/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/deps/tyxml/Html_f/index.html) containing the correct types, values, modules, includes, and documentation.

2. To perform *resolutions*, which is where `odoc` handles complex paths found in OCaml source in order to calculate the correct definition link. For example, in the following snippet:

```ocaml=
module type A = sig
  module M : sig module type S end
  module N : M.S
end

module B : sig module type S = sig type t end end

module C : A with module M = B with type N.t = int

type t = C.N.t
```

resolution is the process by which `odoc` determines which documentation page to take you when you click on `C.N.t`.

The new model has logic to handle many features of the OCaml language, as can be explored [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208094857/http://ocaml.github.io/odoc/features.html).

A particularly important improvement is in handling canonical modules (explained in the link above). The upshot of this is that there should never be any more odd double underscores leaking into your docs!

For some more info on this, as well as the new output renderers, see [our talk at the OCaml workshop last year](https://watch.ocaml.org/videos/watch/2acebff9-25fa-4733-83cc-620a65b12251)

### New Output Renderers

@Drup put a considerable amount of work into replacing the `odoc 1.5` custom HTML generator  with a new rendering layer. This features a new intermediate format allowing new output formats to be added far more easily than before.

Included in `odoc 2.0` are renderers for HTML and man pages (both contributed by @Drup) and LaTeX (contributed by @Octachron). The LaTeX renderer has already been integrated into the OCaml build process to generate docs (see https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9997 and related PRs). @jonludlam also made an alternative HTML renderer designed specifically for [v3.ocaml.org](https://v3.ocaml.org/packages). Finally, a new markdown renderer is being prepared by @lubegasimon and should land in the next release.

We look forward to many new renderers being created for the varied use cases present in the community!

### Output Structure

`odoc 2.0` introduces a new mechanism to specify the structure of the files produced. Although it's a relatively simple new feature, it nevertheless has enabled `odoc` to be used in new ways. In particular, it has allowed `odoc` to construct the
package documentation for the new OCaml website, [v3.ocaml.org](https://v3.ocaml.org/packages). There is also an [example driver](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208094857/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/driver.html), showing how `odoc` can be used to construct a stand-alone website for an OCaml package that contains fully-linked documentation for a package and all of its dependencies. This has been used to create `odoc`'s [new website](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208101345/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/).

### New Drivers

Like the OCaml compiler itself, running `odoc` on your code requires careful sequencing of the invocations to produce the correct result. Fortunately both `dune` and `odig` understand how to do this, so most users don't need to know the details. If you want more than these tools provide though, we've written a simple [reference driver](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208101345/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/driver.html), documenting exactly what's necessary to use `odoc` to produce rich documentation. A more complete (and more complex) example is the tool [voodoo](https://github.com/ocaml-doc/voodoo), which is being used to create the docs for [v3.ocaml.org](https://v3.ocaml.org/packages).

## [v3.ocaml.org](https://v3.ocaml.org)

As previously posted, the new version of the OCaml website has been under development for some time now, and an important new feature is the integration of package listings, including documentation for every version of every package. More has been written about this elsewhere, but it's important to note that the new OCaml.org website required a preview version of `odoc 2.0` to work. We've made a few bug fixes since then, so we will update the pipeline to use the released version very soon. For more info on the pipeline to build the docs, see [our recent talk](https://watch.ocaml.org/videos/watch/9bb452d6-1829-4dac-a6a2-46b31050c931) at this year's OCaml Workshop.

## New Website

The website for `odoc` has been improved with guides for [documentation authors](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208101345/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/odoc_for_authors.html), [integrators](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208101345/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/driver.html), and [contributors](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208101345/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/contributing.html). This site is intended to grow over time with more content to help people write docs for their packages.

## OCamldoc?

This release, particularly because of the new output renderers, puts `odoc` in a place where it supercedes OCamldoc in most respects. There are a few features we're missing (see [the comparison](https://web.archive.org/web/20211208101345/https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/ocamldoc_differences.html) in the docs), including
most notably that we don't render the source (OCamldoc's `--keep-code` argument), and that there is no support for custom tags. If `odoc` is lacking features that you're currently relying on in OCamldoc, we'd love to hear from you!

## More Docs!

Finally, I'd like to use this opportunity to launch an invitation. With [v3.ocaml.org](https://v3.ocaml.org/packages) now showing all the package docs in their current state, I'd like to invite all our package authors, maintainers, contributors, and users to take a look over their favourite packages and see what the documentation looks like. Good documentation is one of the [most important requests](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/suggestions-from-the-ocaml-survey-result/6791) from the previous OCaml developer surveys, and with [v3.ocaml.org](https://v3.ocaml.org/) as a new documentation hub, now is a great time to be making improvements where they're required. With this new release of `odoc`, previewing your docs should be as simple as `dune build @doc`.

Some packages already have great docs - a few examples are:

- [brr](https://ocaml.org/p/brr/latest/doc/ffi_manual.html)
- [lwt](https://ocaml.org/p/lwt/latest/doc/index.html)
- [mimic](https://ocaml.org/p/mimic/latest/doc/index.html)
- [streaming](https://v3.ocaml.org/p/streaming/0.8.0/doc/index.html)
- [uucp](https://v3.ocaml.org/p/uucp/13.0.0/doc/index.html)

many others have more patchy docs. Let's fix that!

We're also looking for more contributors to `odoc`. It's much improved now, but there's still [plenty more to do](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/issues). Come and join the fun!
