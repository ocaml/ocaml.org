We are thrilled to announce the release of `odoc` 2.3.0! üéâ This release is the result of almost a year of diligent work from the `odoc` team since the last major release of `odoc` 2.2.0. It comes packed with significant new features and improvements!

## üó∫Ô∏è Background & Roadmap

Before we delve into the feature highlights, some background on our roadmap and what comes next:

The lack of access to comprehensive documentation for OCaml libraries is one of the biggest pain points reported by the OCaml community, as highlighted in the [2022 OCaml survey](https://ocaml-sf.org/docs/2022/ocaml-user-survey-2022.pdf) (c.f. Q50).

This motivated the `odoc` and OCaml.org teams to jointly work on a centralised package documentation, that [went live in April 2022](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/v3-ocaml-org-we-are-live/9747), as part of the new version of OCaml.org.

With documentation for OCaml libraries [readily available on OCaml.org](https://ocaml.org/packages), we now turn our focus on making sure that library authors have the tooling they need to create high-quality documentation.

Our [roadmap](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) highlights some features we believe will make the generated documentation significantly better for readers and documentation-writing much more pleasant and rewarding. Some notable additions include:

- Source code rendering to be able to inspect the code of a function when reading the documentation
- Global navigation to navigate through the entire API and the standalone documentation pages
- Search bar to search through the documentation
- Special syntax for more markup (e.g., tables, images, etc.)
- Interactive code blocks to offer a notebook-like reading experience
- Support Markdown for standalone documentation pages
- Code blocks can generate rich output (e.g., images, diagrams, etc.) and arbitrary Markup.

This release is a significant milestone in implementing the features on our roadmap and is the precursor to a series of upcoming releases. `odoc` 2.4.0 will follow shortly and will bring support for search. Stay tuned and follow our progress through the [OCaml Platform Newsletter](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/platform-newsletter)!

## ü§ù Join Our Mission

While we are dedicated to developing the best tooling to generate and serve documentation on OCaml.org, creating a well-documented library ecosystem can only be a collective effort. Package authors: join us in our mission to create an ecosystem of well-documented libraries for OCaml! And if you find that writing documentation for your library isn't as straightforward as you would like, please do share your feedback!

## üåü Spotlight Features of `odoc` 2.3.0

1. **Table Support**

  Table support is the last addition to the `odoc` language after
  math. `odoc` supports two markup to include tables: a light one and a
  heavy one. The light markup is similar to Markdown's markup for table,
  producing tables that are readable in the source file as
  well.

  However, this markup has some limitation, since it only allows inline
  content in cells. It can also be difficult to read and mantain for big
  tables without a proper editor support. For this reason, `odoc` also
  provides a "heavy" markup, closer to the HTML one with fewer limitations!

  Here is a table in heavy, light, and rendered form:

  ```
  {t
    Table | support
    ------|--------
    is    | cool!
  }
  ```
  ```
  {table
    {tr {th Table} {th support}}
    {tr {td is} {td cool!}}
  }
  ```

  Table | support
  ------|--------
  is    | cool!

2. **Source Code Rendering**

  Source code rendering is an extremely exciting new feature. Not only is
  `odoc` now able to generate a rendering of the source files (and
  source hierarchy) of a project, but it is also able to create direct
  links from the documentation to the implementation!

  This puts the documentation browsing to a new level by helping to
  quickly answer any implementation-related question!

  The source code rendering is also tailored to OCaml, for instance with
  links from variables to their definition, something missing from
  traditional HTML-based source viewing such as GitHub!
