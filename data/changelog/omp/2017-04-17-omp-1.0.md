date: "2017-04-17"
tags: [omp]
changelog: |
  - Driver: add --as-pp and --embed-errors flags.

    --embed-errors causes the driver to embed exceptions raised by
    rewriters as extension points in the Ast

    --as-pp is a shorthand for: --dump-ast --embed-errors

  - Expose more primitives for embedding the driver.
  - Fix bug where `reset_args` functions where not being called.
  - Fix "OCaml OCaml" in error messages (contributed by Adrien Guatto).
