title: OCaml-eglot Brings Language Server Protocol Support to Emacs
tags: [ocaml-lsp, platform]
---

On January 17, [`ocaml-eglot` version `1.0.0` was released](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-eglot-1-0-0/15978/14), providing a new
minor emacs mode to enable the editor features provided by **ocaml-lsp-server**.
This replaces the venerable “merlin-mode”, after many years of loyal service.

Subsequent releases [`1.1.0`](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot/releases/tag/1.1.0) and [`1.2.0`](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-eglot-1-2-0/16515) enable support for
`flycheck` as a configurable alternative to `flymake` (`1.0.0` release),
Emacs `30.1` support, better user experience and error handling, as
well as support for new features.

Notes:

What else can we write here?

Should this be a post announcing only ocaml-eglot, or are there other ocaml-lsp related efforts worth talking about? I.e. a post giving updates on what has happened about editor support based on ocaml-lsp in general?
