# Emacs Integration for OCaml LSP Server: Introducing ocaml-eglot

## TL;DR

`ocaml-eglot` provides full OCaml language support in Emacs through the Language Server Protocol (LSP) instead of direct Merlin integration. It offers the same features as `merlin.el` with simplified setup and enhanced capabilities like project-wide search. If you're starting fresh or want a more standardized approach, try `ocaml-eglot`, which is actively maintained. If your current `merlin.el` setup works well, you can continue using it.

**Quick start**: [Install `ocaml-lsp-server`, add `ocaml-eglot` to your Emacs config](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), and get the same OCaml development experience with less configuration.

## What is ocaml-eglot?

`ocaml-eglot` connects Emacs to `ocaml-lsp-server` using the Language Server Protocol, providing a standardized way to get OCaml language support.

Since the recent versions of Emacs (29), `eglot`, an LSP client, has been shipped with Emacs. However, `merlin.el` provides more features than LSP (which is designed to be generic), so relying solely on the features of LSP and `eglot` would limit functionality. Thus, we extended the LSP server to support more features, and `ocaml-eglot` allows you to benefit from these features in Emacs.

`ocaml-eglot` is a minor mode. It therefore works in conjunction with a major mode to edit Caml code. Examples of major modes include `tuareg`, `caml-mode` and the recent `neocaml`.

## Who Should Use ocaml-eglot?

**Use ocaml-eglot if you:**
- Are starting fresh with OCaml
- If you use or want to use Emacs
- Want simplified configuration with automatic setup
- Use multiple editors and want consistent OCaml support
- Want access to project-wide search and rename features
- Want to rely on an actively maintained project that evolves over time

If your current setup is working perfectly and is heavily customised, `merlin.el` will still keep working, so there's no immediate need to migrate. However, for the moment, we don't plan to actively maintain `merlin.el` -- unless we receive a lot of requests.

## Getting Started

Follow the [installation instructions in the ocaml-eglot README](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

When migrating from `merlin.el` to `ocaml-eglot`, your existing keybindings should work immediately!

## Features

**Error Navigation:** Quick jump to next/previous errors

**Type Information:** Display types under cursor with adjustable verbosity, navigate enclosing expressions

**Code Generation:** Pattern matching construction, case completion, wildcard refinement via "destruct" feature

**Navigation:** Jump between language constructs (let, module, function, match), navigate phrases and pattern cases

**Search:** Find definitions, declarations, and references

For a detailed list of features, see [the ocaml-eglot README](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot?tab=readme-ov-file#features).

## Next Steps

1. Try the basic setup with an existing OCaml project
2. Explore all the features of `ocaml-eglot`
3. Provide feedback at [ocaml-eglot's GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot/issues)
