We are pleased to announce the minor release of [opam 2.1.4](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.4).

This opam release consists of backported fixes:
  * Make opam able to fully build with OCaml 5.0. `dose3 >= 6.1` and `base64 >= 3.1.0` are now required ([#5357](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5357))
  * Fix a bug where opam would not output any explanation when a conflict arises when attempting to install a package ([#5378](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5378))

Opam installation instructions (unchanged):

1. From binaries: run

    ```
    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh) --version 2.1.4"
    ```

    or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.4) to your PATH. In this case, don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update you sandbox script.

2. From source, using opam:

    ```
    opam update; opam install opam-devel
    ```

   (then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained, and don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update your sandbox script)

3. From source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.1.4#compiling-this-repo).

We hope you enjoy this new minor version, and remain open to [bug reports](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues) and [suggestions](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).
