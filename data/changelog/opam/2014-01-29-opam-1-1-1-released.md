We are proud to announce that *OPAM 1.1.1* has just been released.

This minor release features mostly stability and UI/doc improvements over
OPAM 1.1.0, but also focuses on improving the API and tools to be a better
base for the platform (functions for `opam-doc`, interface with tools like
`opamfu` and `opam-installer`). Lots of bigger changes are in the works, and
will be merged progressively after this release.
