We are happy to announce the first alpha release of opam 2.4.0.

This version is an alpha, we invite users to test it to spot previously unnoticed bugs as we head towards the stable release.

## What‚Äôs new? Some highlights:

* üê≤ **On `opam init` the compiler** chosen for the default switch will **no longer be `ocaml-system`** ([#3509](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/3509))
  This was done because the system compiler (as-is your ocaml installed system wide, e.g. /usr/bin/ocaml) is known to be under-tested and prone to a variety of bugs and configuration issues.
  Removing it from the default compiler allows new-comers a more smooth experience.
  *Note: if you wish to use it anyway, you are always able to do it explicitly using `opam init --compiler=ocaml-system`*

* üê™ GNU **`patch`** and the **`diff`** command are **no longer runtime dependencies**. Instead the OCaml `patch` library is used ([#6019](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6019), [#6052](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6052), [#3782](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/3782), [ocaml/setup-ocaml#933](https://github.com/ocaml/setup-ocaml/pull/933))
  Doing this we've removed some rarely used features of GNU Patch such as the support of [Context diffs](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Example-Context.html).
  The new implementation only supports [Unified diffs](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Example-Unified.html) including the [git extended headers](https://git-scm.com/docs/diff-format), however file permission changes via said extended headers have no effect.

* ‚ùÑÔ∏è Add **Nix support** for **external dependencies (depexts)** by adding support for stateless package managers ([#5982](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5982)). *Thanks to [@RyanGibb](https://github.com/RyanGibb) for this contribution*

* ü™≥ **Fix `opam install <local_dir>`** with and without options like `--deps-only` or `--show-action` having **unexpected behaviours** ([#6248](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6248), [#5567](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5567)) such as:
  * reporting `Nothing to do` despite dependencies or package not being up-to-date
  * asking to install the wrong dependencies

* üåä Many more UI additions and improvements, bug fixes, performance improvements, ‚Ä¶
