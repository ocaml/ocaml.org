## opam-lib 1.3

The package for opam-lib version 1.3 has just been released in the official
<span class="opam">opam</span> repository. There is no release of
<span class="opam">opam</span> with version 1.3, but this is an intermediate
version of the library that retains compatibility of the file formats with
1.2.2.

The purpose of this release is twofold:

- **provide some fixes and enhancements over opam-lib 1.2.2.** For example, 1.3
  has an enhanced `lint` function
- **be a step towards migration to opam-lib 2.0.**

**This version is compatible with the current stable release of opam (1.2.2)**,
but dependencies have been updated so that you are not (e.g.) stuck on an old
version of ocamlgraph.

Therefore, I encourage all maintainers of tools based on opam-lib to migrate to
1.3.

The respective APIs are available in HTML for
[1.2](https://web.archive.org/web/20210511004827/https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/1.2/api/) and [1.3](https://web.archive.org/web/20210511005041/https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/1.3/api/).

> **A note on plugins**: when you write opam-related tools, remember that by
> setting `flags: plugin` in their definition and installing a binary named
> `opam-toolname`, you will enable the users to install package `toolname` and
> run your tool with a single `opam toolname` command.

### Architectural changes

If you need to migrate from 1.2 to 1.3, these tips may help:

- there are now 6 different ocamlfind sub-libraries instead of just 4: `format`
  contains the handlers for opam types and file formats, has been split out from
  the core library, while `state` handles the state of a given opam root and
  switch and has been split from the `client` library.

- `OpamMisc` is gone and moved into the better organised `OpamStd`, with
  submodules for `String`, `List`, etc.

- `OpamGlobals` is gone too, and its contents have been moved to:
  - `OpamConsole` for the printing, logging, and shell interface handling part
  - `OpamXxxConfig` modules for each of the libraries for handling the global
    configuration variables. You should call the respective `init` functions,
    with the options you want to set, for proper initialisation of the lib
    options (and handling the `OPAMXXX` environment variables)

- `OpamPath.Repository` is now `OpamRepositoryPath`, and part of the
  `repository` sub-library.


## opam-lib 2.0 ?

The development version of the opam-lib (`2.0~alpha5` as of writing) is already
available on opam. The name has been changed to provide a finer granularity, so
it can actually be installed concurrently -- but be careful not to confuse the
ocamlfind package names (`opam-lib.format` for 1.3 vs `opam-format` for 2.0).

The provided packages are:

- [`opam-file-format`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-file-format): now
  separated from the opam source tree, this has no dependencies and can be used
  to parse and print the raw opam syntax.
- [`opam-core`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-core): the basic toolbox
  used by opam, which actually doesn't include the opam specific part. Includes
  a tiny extra stdlib, the engine for running a graph of processes in parallel,
  some system handling functions, etc. Depends on ocamlgraph and re only.
- [`opam-format`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-format): defines opam
  data types and their file i/o functions. Depends just on the two above.
- [`opam-solver`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-core): opam's interface
  with the [dose3](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/dose3) library and external
  solvers.
- [`opam-repository`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-repository): fetching
  repositories and package sources from all handled remote types.
- [`opam-state`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-state): handling of the
  opam states, at the global, repository and switch levels.
- [`opam-client`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-client): the client
  library, providing the top-level operations (installing packages...), and CLI.
- [`opam-devel`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-devel): this packages the
  development version of the opam tool itself, for bootstrapping. You can
  install it safely as it doesn't install the new `opam` in the PATH.

The new API can be also be [browsed](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/2.0/api) ;
please get in touch if you have trouble migrating.
