_Feedback on this post is welcomed on [Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-1-0/8255)!_

We are pleased to announce the minor release of [opam 2.0.9](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.9).

This new version contains some [back-ported](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/4547) fixes.

## New features
  * Back-ported ability to load upgraded roots read-only; allows applications compiled with opam-state 2.0.9 to load a root which has been upgraded to opam 2.1 [[#4636](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4636)]
  * macOS sandbox now supports `OPAM_USER_PATH_RO` for adding a custom read-only directory to the sandbox [[#4589](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4589), [#4609](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4609)]
  * `OPAMROOT` and `OPAMSWITCH` now reflect the `--root` and `--switch` parameters in the package build [[#4668](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4668)]
  * When built with opam-file-format 2.1.3+, opam-format 2.0.x displays better errors for newer opam files [[#4394](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4394)]

## Bug fixes
  * Linux sandbox now mounts _host_ `$TMPDIR` read-only, then sets the _sandbox_ `$TMPDIR` to a new separate tmpfs. **Hardcoded `/tmp` access no longer works if `TMPDIR` points to another directory** [[#4589](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4589)]
  * Stop clobbering `DUNE_CACHE` in the sandbox script [[#4535](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4535), fixing [ocaml/dune#4166](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/4166)]
  * Ctrl-C now correctly terminates builds with bubblewrap; sandbox now requires bubblewrap 0.1.8 or later [[#4400](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4400)]
  * Linux sandbox script no longer makes `PWD` read-write on remove actions [[#4589](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4589)]
  * Lint W59 and E60 no longer trigger for packages flagged `conf` [[#4549](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4549)]
  * Reduce the length of temporary file names for pin caching to ease pressure on Windows [[#4590](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4590)]
  * Security: correct quoting of arguments when removing switches [[#4707](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4707)]
  * Stop advertising the removed option `--compiler` when creating local switches [[#4718](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4718)]
  * Pinning no longer fails if the archive's opam file is malformed [[#4580](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4580)]
  * Fish: stop using deprecated `^` syntax to fix support for Fish 3.3.0+ [[#4736](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4736)]

Installation instructions (unchanged):

1. From binaries: run

    ```
    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh) --version 2.0.9"
    ```

    or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.9) to your PATH. In this case, don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update you sandbox script.

2. From source, using opam:

    ```
    opam update; opam install opam-devel
    ```

   (then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained, and don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update your sandbox script)

3. From source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.0.9#compiling-this-repo).

We hope you enjoy this new minor version, and remain open to [bug reports](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues) and [suggestions](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).
