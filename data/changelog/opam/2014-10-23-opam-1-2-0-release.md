We are very proud to announce the availability of OPAM 1.2.0.


### Upgrade from 1.1

Simply follow the usual instructions, using your preferred method (package from
your distribution, binary, source, etc.) as documented on the
[homepage](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

> **NOTE**: There are small changes to the internal repository format (~/.opam).
> It will be transparently updated on first run, but in case you might want to
> go back and have anything precious there, you're advised to back it up.


### Usability

Lot of work has been put into providing a cleaner interface, with helpful
behaviour and messages in case of errors.

The [documentation pages](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/) also have been largely
rewritten for consistency and clarity.

### New features

This is just the top of the list:
* A extended and versatile `opam pin` command. See the
  [Simplified packaging workflow](../opam-1-2-pin)
* More expressive queries, see for example `opam source`
* New metadata fields, including source repositories, bug-trackers, and finer
  control of package behaviour
* An `opam lint` command to check the quality of packages

For more detail, see [the announcement for the beta](../opam-1-2-0-beta4),
[the full changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/1.2.0/CHANGES),
and [the bug-tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues?q=label%3A%22Feature+Wish%22+milestone%3A1.2+is%3Aclosed).


### Package format

The package format has been extended to the benefit of both packagers and users.
The repository already accepts packages in the 1.2 format, and this won't
affect 1.1 users as a rewrite is done on the server for compatibility with 1.1.

If you are hosting a repository, you may be interested in these
[administration scripts](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/master/admin-scripts)
to quickly take advantage of the new features or retain compatibility.
