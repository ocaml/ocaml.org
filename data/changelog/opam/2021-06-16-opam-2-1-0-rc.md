  * Clearer messages about using `--cli` and OPAMCLI [#4655 @dra27]
  * The options `--root` and `--switch` are now reflected in environment
    variables when building packages so that calls to `opam` during build access
    the correct root and switch [#4668 @LasseBlaauwbroek]
  * Add CLI versioning for enums of flags with predefined enums [#4626 @rjbou]
  * Preprocess `--confirm-level` for plugins calls/install [#4694 @rjbou]

  * Fix default invariant with no system compiler [#4644 @AltGr - fix #4640]
