We are pleased to announce a first release candidate for the long-awaited opam 2.0.0.

A lot of polishing has been done since the [last beta](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-beta5/), including tweaks to the built-in solver, allowing in-source package definitions to be gathered in an `opam/` directory, and much more.

With all of the 2.0.0 features getting pretty solid, we are now focusing on bringing all the guides up-to-date[¹](#foot-1), updating the tools and infrastructure, making sure there are no usability issues with the new workflows, and being future-proof so that further updates break as little as possible.

You are invited to read the [beta5 announcement](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-beta5/) for details on the 2.0.0 features. Installation instructions haven't changed:

1. From binaries: run

    ```
    sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
    ```

    or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc) to your PATH.

2. From source, using opam:

    ```
    opam update; opam install opam-devel
    ```

   (then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained)

3. From source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.0.0-rc#opam---a-package-manager-for-ocaml).

Thanks a lot for testing out the RC and [reporting](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues) any issues you may find. See [what we need tested](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-beta5/#What-we-need-tested) for more detail.

<a id="foot-1">¹</a> You can at the moment rely on the [manpages](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/2.0/man/opam.html), the [Manual](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/2.0/Manual.html), and of course the [API](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/2.0/api/), but other pages might be outdated.
