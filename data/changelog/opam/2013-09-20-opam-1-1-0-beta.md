We are very happy to announce the **beta release** of OPAM version 1.1.0!

OPAM is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple
simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and
a Git-friendly development workflow which. OPAM is edited and
maintained by OCamlPro, with continuous support from OCamlLabs and the
community at large (including its main industrial users such as
Jane-Street and Citrix).

Since its first official release [last March][1], we have fixed many
bugs and added lots of [new features and stability improvements][2]. New
features go from more metadata to the package and compiler
descriptions, to improved package pin workflow, through a much faster
update algorithm. The full changeset is included below.

We are also delighted to see the growing number of contributions from
the community to both OPAM itself (35 contributors) and to its
metadata repository (100+ contributors, 500+ unique packages, 1500+
packages). It is really great to also see alternative metadata
repositories appearing in the wild (see for instance the repositories
for [Android][3], [Windows][4] and [so on][5]). To be sure that the
community efforts will continue to benefit to everyone and to
underline our committment to OPAM, we are rehousing it at
`https://opam.ocaml.org` and switching the license to CC0 (see [issue #955][6],
where 85 people are commenting on the thread).

The binary installer has been updated for OSX and x86_64:
- http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam_installer.sh

You can also get the new version either from Anil's unstable PPA:
   add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa-testing
   apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install opam

or build it from sources at :
- http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam-full-1.1.0-beta.tar.gz
- https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/releases/tag/1.1.0-beta

NOTE: If you upgrade from OPAM 1.0, the first time you will run the
new `opam` binary it will upgrade its internal state in an incompatible
way: THIS PROCESS CANNOT BE REVERTED. We have tried hard to make this
process fault-resistant, but failures might happen. In case you have
precious data in your `~/.opam` folder, it is advised to **backup that
folder before you upgrade to 1.1**.
