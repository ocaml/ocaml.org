_Feedback on this post is welcomed on [Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-1-3/10299)!_

We are pleased to announce the minor release of [opam 2.1.3](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.3).

This opam release consists of [backported](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5000) fixes:
  * Fix `opam init` and `opam init --reinit` when the `jobs` variable has been set in the opamrc or the current config. ([#5056](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5056))
  * `opam var` no longer fails if no switch is set ([#5025](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5025))
  * Setting a variable with option `--switch <sw>` fails instead of writing an invalid `switch-config` file ([#5027](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5027))
  * Handle external dependencies when updating switch state pin status (all pins), instead as a post pin action (only when called with `opam pin` ([#5046](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5046))
  * Remove windows double printing on commands and their output ([#4940](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4940))
  * Stop Zypper from upgrading packages on updates on OpenSUSE ([#4978](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4978))
  * Clearer error message if a command doesn't exist ([#4112](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4112))
  * Actually allow multiple state caches to co-exist ([#4554](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4554))
  * Fix some empty conflict explanations ([#4373](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4373))
  * Fix an internal error on admin repository upgrade from OPAM 1.2 ([#4965](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4965))

and improvements:
  * When inferring a 2.1+ switch invariant from 2.0 base packages, don't filter out pinned packages as that causes very wide invariants for pinned compiler packages ([#4501](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4501))
  * Some optimisations to `opam list --installable` queries combined with other filters ([#4311](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4311))
  * Improve performance of some opam list combinations (e.g. `--available`, `--installable`) ([#4999](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4999))
  * Improve performance of `opam list --conflicts-with` when combined with other filters ([#4999](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4999))
  * Improve performance of `opam show` by as much as 300% when the package to show is given explicitly or is unique ([#4997](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4997))([#4172](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4172))
  * When a field is defined in switch and global scope, try to determine the scope also by checking switch selection ([#5027](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5027))

You can also find API changes in the [release note](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.3).

Opam installation instructions (unchanged):

1. From binaries: run

    ```
    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh) --version 2.1.3"
    ```

    or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.3) to your PATH. In this case, don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update you sandbox script.

2. From source, using opam:

    ```
    opam update; opam install opam-devel
    ```

   (then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained, and don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update your sandbox script)

3. From source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.1.3#compiling-this-repo).

We hope you enjoy this new minor version, and remain open to [bug reports](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues) and [suggestions](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).
