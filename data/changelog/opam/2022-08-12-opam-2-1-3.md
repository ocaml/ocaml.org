changelog: |
  * [BUG] Fix `opam init` and `opam init --reinit` when the `jobs` variable has
    been set in the opamrc or the current config. [#5056 @rjbou]
  * When inferring a 2.1+ switch invariant from 2.0 base packages, don't filter
    out pinned packages as that causes very wide invariants for pinned compiler
    packages [#5176 @dra27 - fix #4501]
  * [BUG] Fix an internal error on repository upgrade from OPAM 1.2
    [#4965 @AltGr]
  * Some optimisations to `opam list --installable` queries combined with other
    filters [#4882 @AltGr - fix #4311]
  * Improve performance of some opam list combinations (e.g. `--available`,
    `--installable`) [#4999 @kit-ty-kate]
  * Improve performance of `opam list --conflicts-with` when combined with other
    filters [#4999 @kit-ty-kate]
  * Improve performance of `opam show` by as much as 300% when the package to
    show is given explicitly or is unique [#4998 @kit-ty-kate - fix #4997 and
    partially #4172]
  * [BUG] `opam var` no longer fails if no switch is set
    [#5027 @rjbou - fix #5025]
  * [BUG] Setting a variable with option `--switch <sw>` fails instead of writing
    an invalid `switch-config` file [#5027 @rjbou]
  * When a field is defined in switch and global scope, try to determine the
    scope also by checking switch selection [#5027 @rjbou]
  * [BUG] Handle external dependencies when updating switch state pin status (all
    pins), instead as a post pin action (only when called with `opam pin`
    [#5047 @rjbou - fix #5046]
  * [BUG] When reinstalling a package that has a dirty source, if uncommitted
    changes are the same than the ones stored in opam's cache, opam consider that
    it is up to date and nothing is updated [4879 @rjbou]
  * Stop Zypper from upgrading packages on updates on OpenSUSE
    [#4978 @kit-ty-kate]
  * Clearer error message if a command doesn't exist
    [#4971 @kit-ty-kat - fix #4112]

Opam installation instructions (unchanged):

1. From binaries: run

    ```
    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh) --version 2.1.3"
    ```

    or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.3) to your PATH. In this case, don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update you sandbox script.

2. From source, using opam:

    ```
    opam update; opam install opam-devel
    ```

   (then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained, and don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update your sandbox script)

3. From source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.1.3#compiling-this-repo).

We hope you enjoy this new minor version, and remain open to [bug reports](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues) and [suggestions](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).
