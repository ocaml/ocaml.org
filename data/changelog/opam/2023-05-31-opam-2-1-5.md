_Feedback on this post is welcomed on [Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-1-5-release/12290)!_

We are pleased to announce the patch release of [opam 2.1.5](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.5).

This opam release consists of [backported](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5444) bug & security fixes:

* Security issue: fix opam installing packages without checking their checksum when the  local cache is corrupted in some case ([#5538](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5538)), you can find more information [there](/blog/opam/opam-2-1-5-local-cache).
* Variables are now expanded in build-env (as for setenv) ([#5352](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5352))
* Correctly handle empty environment variable additions ([#5350](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5350))
* Skip empty environment variable additions ([#5350](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5350))
* Fix passing `archive-mirrors` field from init config file to config   ([#5315](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5315))
* git, hg: Use the full SHA1 revision instead of just the 8 first characters   ([#5342](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5342))

Opam installation instructions (unchanged):

1. From binaries: run

    ```
    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh) --version 2.1.5"
    ```

    or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.5) to your PATH. In this case, don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update you sandbox script.

2. From source, using opam:

    ```
    opam update; opam install opam-devel
    ```

   (then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained, and don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update your sandbox script)

3. From source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.1.5#compiling-this-repo).

We hope you enjoy this new minor version, and remain open to [bug reports](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues) and [suggestions](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).
