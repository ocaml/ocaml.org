We are pleased to announce the release of OCamlFormat 0.26.1!

This is the first OCamlFormat release to be compatible with OCaml 5.1.

We highlight notable formatting improvements below:

1. **Removal of extra breaks in constructor declarations**
  ```diff
   type t =                               
     | Foo
     | (* Redirect (None, lib) looks up lib in the same database *)
  -    Redirect of
  -      db option * (Loc.t * Lib_name.t)
  +    Redirect of db option * (Loc.t * Lib_name.t)
  +    
  ```

2. **Consistent formatting for arrow class types, and consistent indentation of the `object` keyword**
  ```diff
  module type S = sig                    
  -  class tttttttttttt : aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:int -> bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb:float ->
  +  class tttttttttttt :
  +    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:int ->
  +    bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb:float ->
      cccccccccccccccccccc
  end

  class type ct =
    let open M in
  -  object
  +object
    val x : t
  end
  ```

We've also fixed a few bugs. Attributes that were previously skipped are not preserved, and we fixed a crash that occured in the presence of nested modules.

Have a look at the full changelog to see the list of improvements, and donâ€™t hesitate to share your feedback on this release on OCaml Discuss.
