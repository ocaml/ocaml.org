tags: [utop, platform]
changelog: |
  * allow to configure the external editor with `UTop.set_external_editor`
  * add `UTop.set_margin_function` to allow users to set
    the margin for the toplevel outcome. It is 80 by default
  * better for quoted strings (`{|...|}`)
  * add a `#pwd` directive
  * experimental support for running utop in the middle of a program
    with `UTop_main.interact`
  * fix Async integration (automatic waiting of `_ Deferred.t` value).
    The new version is more robust against future change in Async
  * fix use of the non-existing `replace-in-string` function in the
    emacs mode (Syohei Yoshida)
  * fallback to Latin-1 for invalid UTF-8 sequences in the compiler output
