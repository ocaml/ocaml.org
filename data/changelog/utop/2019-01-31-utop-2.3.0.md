The new feature in this release is to automatically install
printers marked with `[@@ocaml.toplevel_printer]` (#269 @diml).
Adding this annotation to your libraries will remove the need
to have a separate `top` package to install the printers.

For example, in the [uri](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-uri)
library, the old printing function for `Uri.t` was:

```
val pp_hum : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
```

Just adding this annotation results in `Uri.t` values being automatically
pretty printed in this version of utop.

```
val pp_hum : Format.formatter -> t -> unit [@@ocaml.toplevel_printer]
```
