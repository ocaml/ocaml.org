date: "2013-11-21"
tags: [utop, platform]
changelog: |
  * when evaluating a region/buffer in emacs, evaluate all phrases
    instead of just the first one. Thanks to Matthias Andreas Benkard
    for this feature
  * change the default prompt from `#` to `$` to match the standard
    toplevel
  * add the option `UTop.show_box` to allow one to hide the completion
    bar
  * enhance the lwt/async hooks for automatically waiting on a
    thread/deferred. Hooks were not triggered when the type of the
    expression was a type alias
