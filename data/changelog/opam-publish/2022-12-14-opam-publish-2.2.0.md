We are pleased to announce the minor release of [opam-publish 2.2.0](https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam-publish/releases/tag/2.2.0).

This opam-publish release consists of the following breaking change:
  * Shorten the generated branch name. This is breaking change for people who want to force-push changes on an already opened PR using a previous version of opam-publish as the branch name might not be the same ([#141](https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam-publish/issues/141))

and the following fixes:
  * Fix the github markdown syntax generated by opam-publish ([#131](https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam-publish/issues/131))
  * Disambiguate GitHub archive URL computed from repository and tag ([#135](https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam-publish/issues/135))
  * Upgrade to cmdliner >= 1.1.0 ([#134](https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam-publish/issues/134))
  * Support git remotes with multiple push targets ([#137](https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam-publish/issues/137))
  * Fix broken state if the initial opam-repository clone fails ([#140](https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam-publish/issues/140))
