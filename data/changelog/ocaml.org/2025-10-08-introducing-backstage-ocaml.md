You can [comment on this announcement on the OCaml Discuss forums](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-org-introducing-backstage-ocaml-separate-feeds-for-stable-and-experimental-features/17359)!

We're pleased to announce that OCaml.org now has dedicated RSS feeds and pages for stable and experimental announcements, introduced in [PR #3278](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/3278)!

**What's new:**

- **OCaml Changelog** at [ocaml.org/changelog](https://ocaml.org/changelog) — Official stable release announcements and updates from the OCaml compiler, OCaml infrastructure, and the OCaml Platform Tools
- **Backstage OCaml** at [ocaml.org/backstage](https://ocaml.org/backstage) — Updates on experimental releases, work-in-progress, and opportunities to contribute to the development of the OCaml Platform and its infrastructure

This separation helps keep the main changelog focused on production-ready releases while providing a dedicated space for those interested in experimental work, early testing, and contributing to OCaml's development.

Both pages have their own RSS feeds, so you can subscribe to whichever matches your needs—or both!

We welcome your feedback as we continue improving OCaml.org.
