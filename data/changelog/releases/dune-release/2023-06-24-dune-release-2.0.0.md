title: Dune-release 2.0.0
tags: [dune-release, platform]
changelog: |
  ### Added

  - Adopt the OCaml Code of Conduct (#473, @rikusilvola)
  - Added support for projects that have their OPAM files in the `opam/`
    subdirectory. (#466, @Leonidas-from-XIV)
  
  ### Changed
  
  - Running `dune-release check` now attempts to discover and parse the change
    log, and a new flag `--skip-change-log` disables this behaviour. (#458,
    @gridbugs)
  - List the main package and amount of subpackages when creating the PR to avoid
    very long package lists in PRs (#465, @emillon)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - Avoid collision between branch and tag name. Tag detection got confused when
    branch was named the same as tag. Now it searches only for tag refs, instead
    of all refs. (#452, @3Rafal)
  - Fix project name detection from `dune-project`. The parser could get confused
    when opam file generation is used. Now it only considers the first `(name X)`
    in the file. (#445, @emillon)
  
  ### Removed
  
  - Remove support for delegates.
    Previous users of this feature should now use `dune-release delegate-info`
    and wrap dune-release calls in a script. See #188 for details.
    (#428, @NathanReb)
  - Removed support for the OPAM 1.2.2 client. This means `dune-release` expects
    the `opam` binary to be version 2.0 at least. (#406, #411,
    @Leonidas-from-XIV)

We're excited to announce the release of Dune-release 2.0.0!

This release brings support for putting your `.opam` files in a `opam/`
directory. If your project contains dozens of packages, you'll be able to
generate them into the `opam/` folder starting with Dune 3.8 using `(opam_file_location
inside_opam_directory)` in your `dune-project`.

Another notable change is the removal of delegates. Users of dune-release who
want to publish their packages to another platform than GitHub can now use the
`dune-release delegate-info` and use the output to build their own publication
workflows.
