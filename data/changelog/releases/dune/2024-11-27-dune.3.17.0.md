title: Dune 3.17.0
tags: [dune, platform]
versions: [3.17.0, "3.17.0~alpha0"]
changelog: |
   ### Fixed
   
   - Show the context name for errors happening in non-default contexts.
     (#10414, fixes #10378, @jchavarri)
   
   - Correctly declare dependencies of indexes so that they are rebuilt when
     needed. (#10623, @voodoos)
   
   - Don't depend on coq-stdlib being installed when expanding variables
     of the `coq.version` family (#10631, fixes #10629, @gares)
   
   - Error out if no files are found when using `copy_files`. (#10649, @jchavarri)
   
   - Re_export dune-section private library in the dune-site library stanza,
     in order to avoid failure when generating and building sites modules
     with implicit_transitive_deps = false. (#10650, fixes #9661, @MA0100)
   
   - Expect test fixes: support multiple modes and fix dependencies when there is
     a custom runner (#10671, @vouillon)
   
   - In a `(library)` stanza with `(extra_objects)` and `(foreign_stubs)`, avoid
     double linking the extra object files in the final executable.
     (#10783, fixes #10785, @nojb)
   
   - Map `(re_export)` library dependencies to the `exports` field in `META` files,
     and vice-versa. This field was proposed in to
     https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/proposal-a-new-exports-field-in-findlib-meta-files/13947.
     The field is included in Dune-generated `META` files only when the Dune lang
     version is >= 3.17.
     (#10831, fixes #10830, @nojb)
   
   - Fix staged pps preprocessors on Windows (which were not working at all
     previously) (#10869, fixes #10867, @nojb)
   
   - Fix `dune describe` when an executable is disabled with `enabled_if`.
     (#10881, fixes #10779, @moyodiallo)
   
   - Fix an issue where C stubs would be rebuilt whenever the stderr of Dune was
     redirected. (#10883, fixes #10882, @nojb)
   
   - Fix the URL opened by the command `dune ocaml doc`. (#10897, @gridbugs)
   
   - Fix the file referred to in the error/warning message displayed due to the
     dune configuration version not supporting a particular configuration
     stanza in use. (#10923, @H-ANSEN)
   
   - Fix `enabled_if` when it uses `env` variable. (#10936, fixes #10905, @moyodiallo)
   
   - Fix exec -w for relative paths with --root argument (#10982, @gridbugs)
   
   - Do not ignore the `(locks ..)` field in the `test` and `tests` stanza
     (#11081, @rgrinberg)
   
   - Tolerate files without extension when generating merlin rules.
     (#11128, @anmonteiro)
   
   ### Added
   
   - Make Merlin/OCaml-LSP aware of "hidden" dependencies used by
     `(implicit_transitive_deps false)` via the `-H` compiler flag. (#10535, @voodoos)
   
   - Add support for the -H flag (introduced in OCaml compiler 5.2) in dune
     (requires lang versions 3.17). This adaptation gives
     the correct semantics for `(implicit_transitive_deps false)`.
     (#10644, fixes #9333, ocsigen/tyxml#274, #2733, #4963, @MA0100)
   
   - Add support for specifying Gitlab organization repositories in `source`
     stanzas (#10766, fixes #6723, @H-ANSEN)
   
   - New option to control jsoo sourcemap generation in env and executable stanza
     (#10777, fixes #10673, @hhugo)
   
   - One can now control jsoo compilation_mode inside an executable stanza
     (#10777, fixes #10673, @hhugo)
   
   - Add support for specifying default values of the `authors`, `maintainers`, and
     `license` stanzas of the `dune-project` file via the dune config file. Default
     values are set using the `(project_defaults)` stanza (#10835, @H-ANSEN)
   
   - Add names to source tree events in performance traces (#10884, @jchavarri)
   
   - Add `codeberg` as an option for defining project sources in dune-project
     files. For example, `(source (codeberg user/repo))`. (#10904, @nlordell)
   
   - `dune runtest` can now run individual tests with `dune runtest mytest.t`
     (#11041, @Alizter).
   
   - Wasm_of_ocaml support (#11093, @vouillon)
   
   - Add a `coqdep_flags` field to the `coq` field of the `env` stanza, and to the
     `coq.theory` stanza, allowing to configure `coqdep` flags. (#11094,
     @rlepigre)
   
   ### Changed
   
   - Remove all remnants of the experimental `patch-back-source-tree`. (#10771,
     @rgrinberg)
   
   - Change the preset value for author and maintainer fields in the
     `dune-project` file to encourage including emails. (#10848, @punchagan)
   
   - Tweak the preset value for tags in the `dune-project` file to hint at topics
     not having a special meaning. (#10849, @punchagan)
   
   - Change some colors to improve readability in light-mode terminals
     (#10890, @gridbugs)
   
   - Forward the linkall flag to jsoo in whole program compilation as well (#10935, @hhugo)
   
   - Configurator uses `pkgconf` as pkg-config implementation when available
     and forwards it the `target` of `ocamlc -config`. (#10937, @pirbo)
   
   - Enable Dune cache by default. Add a new Dune cache setting
     `enabled-except-user-rules`, which enables the Dune cache, but excludes
     user-written rules from it. This is a conservative choice that can avoid
     breaking rules whose dependencies are not correctly specified. This is the
     current default. (#10944, #10710, @nojb, @ElectreAAS)
   
   - Do not add `dune` dependency in `dune-project` when creating projects with
     `dune init proj`. The Dune dependency is implicitely added when generating
     opam files (#11129, @Leonidas-from-XIV)

We're happy to announce the release of Dune 3.17.0.

Among the list of chances, this release enables the Dune cache by default for
known-safe operations, adds support for `Wasm_of_ocaml`, adds support for the
`-H` compiler flag introduced in OCaml 5.2 and allows specifying code hosting
services like Codeberg or Gitlab organizations.
