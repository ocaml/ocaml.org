    ### Fixed

    - When a library declares `(no_dynlink)`, then the `.cmxs` file for it
      is no longer built. (#11176, @nojb)

    - Fix bug that could result in corrupted file copies by Dune, for example when
      using the `copy_files#` stanza or the `copy#` action. (@nojb, #11194, fixes
      #11193)

    - Remove useless error message when running `$ dune subst` in empty projects.

The Dune team is happy to announce the release of Dune 3.17.1!

This patch release includes some bug fixes. To reduce computing time, it does
not build `.cmxs` files anymore when the `(no_dynlink)` stanza is used instead.
This behavior also corrects the semantic of the `(no_dynlink)` stanza which was
building but not installing `.cmxs` files. It does not try to build and install them anymore.
