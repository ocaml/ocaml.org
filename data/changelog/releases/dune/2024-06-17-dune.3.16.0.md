title: Dune 3.16.0
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
   ### Added
   
   - Allow libraries with the same `(name ..)` in projects as long as they don't
     conflict during resolution (via `enabled_if`). (#10307, @anmonteiro,
     @jchavarri)
   
   - `dune describe pp` now finds the exact module and the stanza it belongs to,
     instead of guessing the name of the preprocessed file. (#10321, @anmonteiro)
   
   - Print the result of `dune describe pp` with the respective dialect printer.
     (#10322, @anmonteiro)
   
   - Add new flag `--context` to `dune ocaml-merlin`, which allows to select a
     Dune context when requesting Merlin config. Add `dune describe contexts`
     subcommand. Introduce a field `generate_merlin_rules` for contexts declared
     in the workspace, that allows to optionally produce Merlin rules for other
     contexts besides the one selected for Merlin (#10324, @jchavarri)
   
   - Melange: add include paths for private library `.cmj` files during JS
     emission. (#10416, @anmonteiro)
   
   - `dune ocaml-merlin`: communicate additional directives `SOURCE_ROOT`,
     `UNIT_NAME` (the actual name with wrapping) and `INDEX` with the paths to the
     index(es). (#10422, @voodoos)
   
   - Add a new alias `@ocaml-index` that uses the `ocaml-index` binary to generate
     indexes that can be read by tools such as Merlin to provide project-wide
     references search. (#10422, @voodoos)
   
   - Merlin: add optional `(merlin_reader CMD)` construct to `(dialect)` stanza to
     configure a Merlin reader (#8567, @andreypopp)
   
   ### Changed
   
   - Melange: treat private libraries with `(package ..)` as public libraries,
     fixing an issue where `import` paths were wrongly emitted. (#10415,
     @anmonteiro)
   
   - Install `.glob` files for Coq theories too (#10602, @ejgallego)
   
   ### Fixed
   
   - Don't try to document nonexistent libraries in doc-new target (#10319, fixes
     #10056, @jonludlam)
   
   - Make `dune-site`'s `load_all` function look for `META` files so that it
     doesn't fail on empty directories in the plugin directory (#10458, fixes
     #10457, @shym)
   
   - Fix incorrect warning for libraries defined inside nonexistant directories
     using `(subdir ..)` and used by executables using `dune-build-info` (#10525,
     @rgrinberg)
   
   - Don't try to take build lock when running `coq top --no-build` (#10547, fixes
     #7671, @lzy0505)
   
   - Make sure to truncate Dune's lock file after locking and unlocking so that
     users cannot observe incorrect PID's (#10575, @rgrinberg)
   
   - MDX: link MDX binary with `byte_complete`. This fixes `(libraries)` with
     foreign archives on Linux. (#10586, fixes #10582, @anmonteiro)
   
   - Virtual libraries: fix an issue where linking an executable involving several
     virtual libries would cause an error. (#10581, fixes #10460, @rgrinberg)

We're happy to announce the release of Dune 3.16.0.

Among the list of chances, this release contains improvements to Melange
support and a way to look for references in a whole project using Merlin and
OCaml LSP.
