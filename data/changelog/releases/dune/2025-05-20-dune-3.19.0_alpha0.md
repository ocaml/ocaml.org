    ### Fixed

    *   Fixed a bug that was causing cram tests attached to multiple aliases to be run multiple  
        times. ([#11547](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11547), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter))
        
    *   Fix: pass pkg-config (extra) args in all pkgconfig invocations. A missing --personality  
        flag would result in pkgconf not finding libraries in some contexts. ([#11619](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11619), [@MisterDA](https://github.com/MisterDA))
        
    *   Fix: Evaluate `enabled_if` when computing the stubs for stanzas such as  
        `foreign_library` ([#11707](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11707), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter), [@rgrinberg](https://github.com/rgrinberg))
        
    *   Fix $ dune describe pp for libraries in the presence of `(include_subdirs unqualified)` ([#11729](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11729), fixes [#10999](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/10999), [@rgrinberg](https://github.com/rgrinberg))
        
    *   Fix `$ dune subst` in sub directories of a git repository ([#11760](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11760), fixes  
        [#11045](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/11045), [@Richard-Degenne](https://github.com/Richard-Degenne))
        
    *   Fix a crash involving `Path.drop_prefix` when using Melange on Windows  
        ([#11767](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11767), [@nojb](https://github.com/nojb))
        

    ### Added

    *   Added detection and warning for common typos in package dependency  
        constraints ([#11600](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11600), fixes [#11575](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/11575), [@kemsguy7](https://github.com/kemsguy7))
        
    *   Added `(extra_objects)` field to `(foreign_library)` stanza with `(:include)` support.  
        ([#11683](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11683), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter))
        

    ### Changed

    *   Allow build RPC messages to be handled by dune's RPC server in eager watch  
        mode ([#11622](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11622), [@gridbugs](https://github.com/gridbugs))
        
    *   Allow concurrent build with RPC server ([#11712](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11712), [@gridbugs](https://github.com/gridbugs))

Dune 3.19.0~alpha0 is now available. This alpha release includes several bug fixes and new features for OCaml developers.

## Bug Fixes

This release addresses several issues that affected build reliability and functionality:

- **Cram tests**: Fixed duplicate execution of cram tests attached to multiple aliases
- **pkg-config integration**: Resolved missing `--personality` flag in pkgconfig invocations that prevented library detection in certain contexts
- **Foreign libraries**: Fixed evaluation of `enabled_if` conditions when computing stubs for `foreign_library` stanzas
- **Preprocessing**: Corrected `dune describe pp` behavior for libraries using `(include_subdirs unqualified)`
- **Git integration**: Fixed `dune subst` functionality in subdirectories of git repositories
- **Windows compatibility**: Resolved crash in `Path.drop_prefix` when using Melange on Windows

## New Features

- **Dependency validation**: Added automatic detection and warnings for common typos in package dependency constraints
- **Foreign library support**: Added `(extra_objects)` field to `(foreign_library)` stanza with `(:include)` support

## Improvements

- **RPC server**: Enhanced RPC server to handle build messages in eager watch mode and support concurrent builds

## Installation

Install via opam:

```bash
opam install dune.3.19.0~alpha0
```
