    ## Differences Between alpha0 and alpha1:

    ### Added in alpha1:
    *   Added a `(timeout <float>)` field to the `(cram)` stanza to specify per-test  
        time limits. Tests exceeding the timeout are terminated with an error.  
        ([#12041](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/12041), [@Alizter](https://github.com/Alizter))

    ### Reference Changes:
    *   RPC warning entry changed from referencing issue [#11836](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/11836) in alpha0 to pull request [#11833](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11833) in alpha1

We released Dune 3.20.0_alpha1 as a minor alpha release that adds one new feature and fixes a documentation reference:

- **New Feature**: Added timeout support for cram tests - you can now specify `(timeout <float>)` in cram stanzas to automatically terminate tests that run too long
- **Documentation Fix**: Corrected a reference in the RPC warning changelog entry

This unstable alpha release builds on alpha0 with minimal changes focused on improving test reliability and documentation accuracy.
