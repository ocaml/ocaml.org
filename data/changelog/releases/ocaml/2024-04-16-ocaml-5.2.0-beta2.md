Last week, we merged an update to the compiler-libs "shape" API for querying definition information from the compiler.

Unfortunately, this small change of API breaks compatibility with at least odoc.
Generally, we try to avoid this kind of changes during the beta releases of the
compiler. However, after discussions we concluded that it will be easier on the
long term to fix the API right now in order to avoid multiplying the number of
supported versions of the shape API in the various OCaml developer tools .

We have thus released a second beta version of OCaml 5.2.0 to give the time to developer tools to update their 5.2.0 version ahead of the release (see below for the installation instructions).

Beyond this changes of API, the new beta contains three more bug fixes and three
documentation updates, which is a good sign in term of stability.

As usual, you can follow the last remaining compatibility slags on the
[opam readiness for 5.2.0 meta-issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/25182).

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

Currently, the release is planned for the beginning of May.

If you are interested in full list of features and bug fixes of the new OCaml version, the
updated change log for OCaml 5.2.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.2/Changes).

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.2.0~beta2
```

The source code for the beta is also available at these addresses:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.2.0-beta2.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.2/ocaml-5.2.0~beta2.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.2.0~beta2+options <option_list>
```

where `option_list` is a space-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:

```bash
opam switch create 5.2.0~beta2+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.2.0~beta2+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
