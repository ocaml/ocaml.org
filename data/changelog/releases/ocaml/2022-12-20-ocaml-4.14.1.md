We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Oronce Finé by announcing the release of OCaml version 4.14.1.

This release is a collection of safe bug fixes, cherry-picked from the OCaml 5.0.0 release. If you were using OCaml 4.14.0 and cannot yet upgrade to OCaml 5, this release is for you.

The 4.14 branch is expected to receive more backported fixes during the maturation of OCaml 5. Thus don't hesitate to report any bugs on the [OCaml issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

See the list of changes below for more details.
