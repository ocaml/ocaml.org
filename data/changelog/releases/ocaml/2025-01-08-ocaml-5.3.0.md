      module HT = Hashtbl.Make(struct
        ...
        let hash = Uchar.to_int
      end)
    ```
    If the current implementation is desired, and you have a hashtable module `HT`
    (produced with the `Make` functor) in persistent storage, use `HT.rebuild` to
    ensure it doesn't break when reading from or writing to buckets.

    an empty list of universally quantified type variables
    (`. int -> int` instead of `'a . int -> int'`)

    bytecode linker in `-custom` and `-output-*` modes.

    during the build of the compiler itself. Do not use them when

---

We have the pleasure of announcing the release of OCaml version 5.3.0. dedicated
to the memory of John William Mauchly and Paul Verlaine on the anniversary of
their death.

>  De la musique avant toute chose,
>  Et pour cela préfère l’Impair

> (Music first and foremost of all!
>  Choose your measure of odd not even)

Some of the highlights in OCaml 5.3.0 are:

- Syntax for deep effect handlers

  There is now a dedicated syntax for installing deep effect handler
  ```ocaml
  match f () with
  | x -> x
  | effect Random_float, k -> Effect.Deep.continue k (Random.float 1.0)
  ```
  This new syntax adds a new `effect` keyword, which may break existing code.
  To improve backward compatibility, this new keyword can be disabled with
  the new `-keywords` flags if needed for backward compatibility.

- Restored MSVC port

  It is now possible to use the MSVC toolchain on Windows, restoring the last
  missing port from OCaml 4 (except for the native compiler support for 32-bit
  architectures which is not planned)

- Re-introduced statistical memory profiling (statmemprof)

  The submodule `Gc.memprof` is restored with a slightly different API. This
  submodule can be used to monitor memory allocation statistics inside a
  program. In OCaml 5, each domain can be monitored independently while child
  domains inherit the parent domain profiling profile (if there is one active).

- utf-8 encoded Unicode source files and modest support of Unicode identifiers
  ```ocaml
  type saison = Hiver | Été | Printemps | Automne
  ```
  The OCaml lexer has been extended to support a modest subset of Unicode
  characters in identifiers. This is mostly intended for pedagogical use. This
  extended support requires source files to be utf-8 encoded Unicode text.

- More space-efficient implementation of Dynarray

  The internal implementation of `Dynarray` now uses an unboxed representation
  which avoids the need of storing items wrapped in a `Some x` block and thus
  saves some spaces and indirections.

- Improved metadata on the pairs of declarations and definitions for merlin.

  The metadata stored inside cmt files has been improved to better distinguish the provenance of identifiers (previous versions could confuse an interface and implementation identifier).
  Similarly, the metadata now tracks more precisely the association between declarations and definitions. For instance, in
  ```ocaml
  module X = struct let x = 0 end
  module M: sig
    val x: int
  end = struct
    let x = 1
    include X
  end
  ```
  Merlin can now determine that the definition of the `M.x` value lies inside the module `X`.

And a lot of incremental changes:

- Around 20 new functions in the standard library (in the `Domain`, `Dynarray`
`Format`, `List`, `Queue`, `Sys`, and `Uchar` modules).
- Many fixes and improvements in the runtime
- Improved error messages for first-class modules, functors, labelled arguments,
  and type clashes.
- Numerous bug fixes

Please report any unexpected behaviours on the [OCaml issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues)
and post any questions or comments you might have on our
[discussion forums](https://discuss.ocaml.org).


The full list of changes can be found in the full changelog.

---

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.3.0
```

The source code for the release is also directly available on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/releases/download/5.3.0/ocaml-5.3.0.tar.gz)
* [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.3/ocaml-5.3.0.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.3.0+options <option_list>
```
where `<option_list>` is a space separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
```bash
opam switch create 5.3.0+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.3.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```
