  ### Standard library:
  
  * (*breaking change*) [#12562](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12562), [#12734](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12734), [#12783](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12783): Remove the `Marshal.Compression` flag to the
    `Marshal.to_*` functions introduced in 5.1 by [#12006](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12006), as it cannot
    be implemented without risking to link `-lzstd` with all
   `ocamlopt`-generated executables. The compilers are still able to use
    ZSTD compression for compilation artefacts.

---

In the last three months after the release of OCaml 5.1.0, three
significant regressions have been discovered in OCaml 5.1.0.
Those regressions concern the packaging of executables,
the typechecking of OCaml programs, and the performance of numerical codes.

Since those regressions affect many users and could have lasting effects, we
have published patch release OCaml 5.1.1 fixing those issues. 

As a major exception to our policy for patch releases, OCaml 5.1.1 will contain
one breaking change in the standard library: the `Compression` flag has been
removed from the `Marshal` module.

This drastic measure was taken because supporting ZSTD compression in the
standard library made ZSTD a dependency of all OCaml executables. Since the
compiler should not impose its dependency on end users, the support for
compressed marshaling has been moved to a compiler internal library in 5.1.1.

Accounting for the still-experimental nature of the Multicore runtime, this
patch release 5.1.1 also contains safe fixes for subtle concurrency issues in
the OCaml runtime.

The full list of changes is available below for more details.

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.1
```
