Four months after the release of OCaml 5.3.0, the set of new features for the
future version 5.4.0 of OCaml has been frozen. We are thus happy to announce the
first alpha release for OCaml 5.4.0.

This alpha version is here to help fellow hackers join us early in our bug
hunting and opam ecosystem fixing fun (see below for the installation
instructions).

The progresses on stabilising the ecosystem are tracked on the [opam readiness for 5.4.0 meta-issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/27916).

The full release is expected around the end of July.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

If you are interested in the ongoing list of new features and bug fixes, you can have a look at
[the changelog for OCaml 5.4.0](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.4/Changes).

Happy hacking,
Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1 and later:

```
opam update
opam switch create 5.4.0~alpha1
```

The source code for the alpha is also available at these addresses:

## Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.4.0~alpha1+options <option_list>
```

where `option_list` is a space separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a flambda and no-flat-float-array switch:

```
opam switch create 5.4.0~alpha1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.4.0~alpha1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
