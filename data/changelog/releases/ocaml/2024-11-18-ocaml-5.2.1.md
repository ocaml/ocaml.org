  ## Changes Since OCaml 5.2.0
  ### Runtime System:
  - [#13207](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13207): Be sure to reload the register caching the exception handler in
    `caml_c_call` and `caml_c_call_stack_args`, as its value may have been changed
    if the OCaml stack is expanded during a callback.
    (Miod Vallat, report by Vesa Karvonen, review by Gabriel Scherer and
     Xavier Leroy)
  
  - [#13252](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13252): Rework register assignment in the interpreter code on m68k on Linux,
    due to the %a5 register being used by GLIBC.
    (Miod Vallat, report by Stéphane Glondu, review by Gabriel Scherer and
     Xavier Leroy)
  
  - [#13268](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13268): Fix a call to test in `configure.ac` that was causing errors when
    LDFLAGS contains several words.
    (Stéphane Glondu, review by Miod Vallat)
  
  - [#13234](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13234), [#13267](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13267): Open runtime events file in read-write mode on ARMel
    (ARMv5) systems due to atomic operations limitations on that
    platform.
    (Stéphane Glondu, review by Miod Vallat and Vincent Laviron)
  
  - [#13188](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13188): fix races in the FFI code coming from the use of `Int_val(...)`
    on rooted values inside blocking questions / without the runtime lock.
    (Calling `Int_val(...)` on non-rooted immediates is fine, but any
     access to rooted values must be done outside blocking sections /
     with the runtime lock.)
    (Etienne Millon, review by Gabriel Scherer, Jan Midtgaard, Olivier Nicole)
  
  - [#13318](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13318): Fix regression in GC alarms, and fix them for Flambda.
    (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, report by Benjamin Monate, review by
     Vincent Laviron and Gabriel Scherer)
  
  - [#13140](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13140): POWER back-end: fix issue with call to `caml_call_realloc_stack`
    from a DLL
    (Xavier Leroy, review by Miod Vallat)
  
  - [#13370](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13370): Fix a low-probability crash when calling `Gc.counters`.
    (Demi Marie Obenour, review by Gabriel Scherer)
  
  - [#13402](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13402), [#13512](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13512), [#13549](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13549), [#13553](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13553): Revise bytecode implementation of callbacks
    so that it no longer produces dangling registered bytecode fragments.
    (Xavier Leroy, report by Jan Midtgaard, analysis by Stephen Dolan,
     review by Miod Vallat)
  
  - [#13502](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13502): Fix misindexing related to `Gc.finalise_last` that could prevent
    finalisers from being run.
    (Nick Roberts, review by Mark Shinwell)
  
  - [#13520](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13520): Fix compilation of native-code version of systhreads. Bytecode fields
    were being included in the thread descriptors.
    (David Allsopp, review by Sébastien Hinderer and Miod Vallat)

We have the pleasure of announcing the release of OCaml 5.2.1, dedicated to the
memory of Niels Bohr and Paul Éluard on the anniversary of their deaths.

OCaml 5.2.1 is a collection of safe but import runtime time bug fixes backported
from the 5.3 branch of OCaml.

The full list of changes is available above for more details.
