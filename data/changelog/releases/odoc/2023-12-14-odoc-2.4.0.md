The odoc team is delighted to announce the release of odoc 2.4.0. It mainly contains support for search engines. There are of course bugfixes and smaller new features.

## üåü Spotlight Feature of Odoc 2.4.0 : Search

Odoc now support searching in the documentation ! The search is made to run in the browser, so that you do not need a server to enable search: you can have search on your documentation hosted on github pages or even locally on your machine.

No search engine is shipped with, you need to provide one, but all the facilities to make use of one are present. We adapted @art-w 's [sherlodoc](https://github.com/art-w/sherlodoc/tree/jsoo) for seamless integration with odoc, alongside with new features. It is not yet released on opam, but we hope it will be soon.

You can already test sherlodoc and play with it on your own projects, there are instructions in its [readme](https://github.com/art-w/sherlodoc/blob/jsoo/README.md). Sherlodoc has fuzzy typed-based search like [hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) in the haskell world, and is made to work best for OCaml (unlike a general purpose search engine like elastic search).

Check the results on odoc's own online documentation : [ocaml.github.io/odoc](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/).

## ü§ù Join The Mission

While we are dedicated to developing the best tooling to generate and serve documentation on OCaml.org, creating a well-documented library ecosystem can only be a collective effort. Package authors: we‚Äôre working hard to give you great tools, but we‚Äôll need all your help to create an ecosystem of well-documented libraries for OCaml!

If you find that writing documentation for your library isn‚Äôt as straightforward as you would like, please do share your feedback with us.
