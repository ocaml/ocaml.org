We're excited to announce the release of odoc 3.1.0! This release brings several new features, important improvements, and bug fixes to OCaml's documentation generator.

## What's New

### OCaml 5.4.0 Compatibility
Full support for OCaml 5.4.0 has been added, ensuring odoc stays current with the latest OCaml releases.

### New Output Formats and Options
- **Enhanced LaTeX Generator**: New command-line arguments `--shorten-beyond-depth` and `--remove-functor-arg-link` provide more control over LaTeX output formatting

## Key Improvements

### Modernized Dependencies
The cmdliner compatibility layer has been removed as it's no longer needed, simplifying the codebase and reducing maintenance overhead.

### Updated System Requirements  
Support for OCaml versions prior to 4.08 has been dropped, allowing the project to leverage more modern language features and reduce compatibility complexity.

### Better Configuration Management
Libraries from packages can now be referenced when added in `odoc-config.sexp`, improving flexibility in documentation project setup.

### Improved LaTeX Output
- Heading labels now use full paths to improve navigation and reference accuracy
- Page and anchor separation in LaTeX labels prevents naming collisions

## Bug Fixes

This release addresses several important issues:
- Fixed META file parsing when dependencies are absent
- Resolved rendering problems on medium screen sizes without global sidebar
- Corrected occurrence generation for documentation CI systems  
- Ensured hidden pages never receive links, preventing broken references

## Getting Started

To install odoc 3.1.0:

```bash
opam install odoc
```

For existing users, upgrade with:

```bash
opam upgrade odoc
```
