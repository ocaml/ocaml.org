We are delighted to announce the release of Odoc 3! This is a big release with loads of new features and bug fixes, and we encourage everyone to install it and try the new features!

This release has been cooking for a long time - it’s been more than a year since odoc 2.4 landed, and a huge amount of work has gone into this. Thanks to the many others who contributed, either by code or by comments: @juloo, @panglesd, @EmileTrotignon, @gpetiot, @trefis, @sabine, @dbuenzli, @yawaramin, and more.

Here is an overview of some major new features:

- Search by type! Our detective sherlodoc will find your lost value given its type.
- Odoc 3 features a global sidebar, allowing you to discover all documentation pages
- The generated documentation include the source code. You can jump from any item in the documentation straight to its rendered source; no matter how much of OCaml’s complex module system you are using.
- You can now add images to your documentation, as well as video and audio files
Hierarchical documentation pages allow you to structure your documentation better
- Reference items from other packages! With the ability to use cross-package links in your documentation, the generated documentation is now truly connected.
- The build dependencies are friendlier with incremental build systems, allowing better shared build caches

With this release we’re including a driver that makes use of all the exciting new features of odoc. This driver has been used to create the [docs site for the various odoc tools](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/). However, Dune does not yet support odoc 3 since the Dune rules for running odoc via Dune need to be rewritten to reflect the odoc's new CLI and the new incremental build related capabilities odoc 3 brings.

Until Dune supports odoc 3, here is how to get started:

```sh
$ opam install odoc-driver # will install odoc 3
$ odoc_driver odoc odoc-parser odoc-driver odoc-md sherlodoc --remap
```

and point your browser at `_html/index.html`. This example shows `odoc_driver` creating the docs for exactly the 5 packages specified. While doing so, it will remap links to other packages to instead link to their documentation page hosted on [ocaml.org](https://ocaml.org) (see ["Remapping dependencies" in the odoc documentation](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/odoc-driver/index.html#remapping-dependencies)).

If you try the above command, you'll note something interesting, and hopefully this will encourage you to run `odoc_driver` on your own packages before you release them, as then you'll be able to avoid slightly embarrassing post-release fixes like [this one](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1333) 😬
