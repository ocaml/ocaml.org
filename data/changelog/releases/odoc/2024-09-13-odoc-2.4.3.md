    ### Fixed

    *   Fix missing katex headers ([@panglesd](https://github.com/panglesd), [#1096](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1096))
    *   Allow `][` in code blocks, fixing issue [#1137](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/issues/1137) ([@Julow](https://github.com/Julow), [#1149](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1149))  
        This was interpreted as "code blocks with result", which now mandates a  
        delimiter: `{delim@lang[ code ]delim[ result ]}`
    *   Fix misprinting of type variables from ml files for OCaml 4.14 and later  
        (multiple occurences of the same type variable could be named differently)  
        ([@Octachron](https://github.com/Octachron), [#1173](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1173))

We're happy to announce the release of Odoc 2.4.3!

This release includes three key fixes: we restored missing KaTeX headers for proper mathematical rendering, resolved an issue where `][` characters in code blocks were incorrectly interpreted as "code blocks with result" (now requiring explicit delimiters), and corrected the misprinting of type variables from ML files in OCaml 4.14 and later versions where multiple instances of the same type variable could be displayed with different names.
