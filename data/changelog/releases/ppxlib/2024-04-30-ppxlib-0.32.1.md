The ppxlib team is happy to announce the release of ppxlib.0.32.1.

The main feature of this release is of course the support for the upcoming OCaml
5.2 release. Starting with this version you'll be able to use ppx with the
latest compiler.

The feature also comes with a small follow up improvement to the 0.32.0 error
reporting changes that simplifies how exception thrown from context free
rewriting are handled. The errors will now be inserted where the generated code
would have been instead of appended to the whole AST. This should lead to a
better error reporting from the compiler as it will now report errors in order
of their position in the code. 

We'd like to thank the OCaml Software Foundation once again as they funded the
vast majority of the work for this release.
