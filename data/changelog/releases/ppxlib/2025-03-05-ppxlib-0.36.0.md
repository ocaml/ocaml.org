title: Ppxlib 0.36.0
tags: [ppxlib, platform]
changelog: |

  - Change `Location.none` to match the compiler's `Location.none` as of OCaml
  4.08. This fixes a bug in `loc_of_attribute` (#540, @ncik-roberts, @patricoferris)

  - Bump ppxlib's AST to 5.2.0 (#514, @patricoferris)

  - Add the `[@@@expand_inline]` transformation and support for floating attribute context
  free transformations. (#560, @jaymody)

  - Add a `-raise-embedded-errors` flag to the driver. Setting this flag raises the first
  `ocaml.error` embedded in the final AST.

  - Export `Ast_pattern.fail`. (#563, @ceastlund)

  - Make `Ast_traverse.sexp_of` more concise, and add a test. (#561, @ceastlund)

We are happy to announce the release of ppxlib.0.36.0!

With this release, the internal AST that ppxlib targets has been bumped to the AST of OCaml 5.2.
Ppx authors can now use features from OCaml 5.2. Ppxlib still supports any OCaml compiler
after and including 4.08.0.

Many ppxes will be broken by changes made to the representation of functions. Authors are encouraged
to read [the upgrade guide](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib/wiki/Upgrading-to-ppxlib-0.36.0).
