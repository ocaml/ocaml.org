    ## Features  
    - Add custom `ocamllsp/typeSearch` request ([#1369](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1369))  
    - Make MerlinJump code action configurable ([#1376](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1376))  
    - Add custom `ocamllsp/jump` request ([#1374](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1374))  

    ## Fixes  
    - Deactivate the jump code actions by default. Clients can enable them with the `merlinJumpCodeActions` configuration option. Alternatively, a custom request is provided for ad hoc use of the feature. ([#1411](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1411))  
    - Fix FD leak in running external processes for preprocessing ([#1349](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1349))  
    - Fix prefix parsing for completion of object methods ([#1363](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1363), fixes [#1358](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/issues/1358))  
    - Remove some duplicates in the `selectionRange` answers ([#1368](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1368))

    We are excited to share the release of **OCaml-LSP 1.20.1**, which introduces powerful new features and vital bug fixes to improve your development workflow. The new `typeSearch` request allows you to find values by type signature or polarity, making it easier to locate the functionality you need. Configurable `MerlinJump` actions and the custom `jump` request give you more control over code navigation. On the bug fix side, we have tackled issues like file descriptor leaks, enhanced method completion, and cleaned up duplicate responses in `selectionRange`.
