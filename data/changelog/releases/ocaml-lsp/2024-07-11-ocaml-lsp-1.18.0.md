title: OCaml-LSP 1.18.0
tags: [ocaml-lsp, platform]
changelog: |
  ## Features

  - Introduce a configuration option to control Dune diagnostics. The option is called `duneDiganostics`, and it may be set to `{ enable: false }` to disable diagnostics. (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1221)

  - Support folding of `ifthenelse` expressions (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1031)

  - Improve hover behavior (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1245)

    Hovers are no longer displayed on useless parse tree nodes such as keywords, comments, etc.
    
    Multiline hovers are now filtered away.

    Display expanded PPXs in the hover window.

  - Improve document symbols (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1247)

    Use the parse tree instead of the typed tree. This means that document
    symbols will work even if the source code doesn't type check.

    Include symbols at arbitrary depth.

    Differentiate functions / types / variants / etc.

    This now includes PPXs like `let%expect_test` or `let%bench` in the outline.

  - Introduce a `destruct-line` code action. This is an improved version of the
    old `destruct` code action. (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1283)

  - Improve signature inference to only include types for elements that were
    absent from the signature. Previously, all signature items would always be
    inserted. (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1289)

  - Add an `update-signature` code action to update the types of elements that
    were already present in the signature (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1289)

  - Add custom
    [`ocamllsp/merlinCallCompatible`](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/blob/e165f6a3962c356adc7364b9ca71788e93489dd0/ocaml-lsp-server/docs/ocamllsp/merlinCallCompatible-spec.md)
    request (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1265)

  - Add custom [`ocamllsp/typeEnclosing`](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/blob/109801e56f2060caf4487427bede28b824f4f1fe/ocaml-lsp-server/docs/ocamllsp/typeEnclosing-spec.md) request (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1304)


  ## Fixes

  - Detect document kind by looking at Merlin's `suffixes` config.

    This enables more LSP features for non-`.ml/.mli` files. Though it still
    depends on Merlin's support. (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1237)

  - Correctly accept the `--clientProcessId` flag. (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1242)

  - Disable automatic completion and signature help inside comments (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1246)

  - Includes a new optional/configurable option to toggle syntax documentation. If
    toggled on, allows display of syntax documentation on hover tooltips. Can be
    controlled via environment variables and by GUI for VS code. (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1218)

  - For completions on labels that the LSP gets from Merlin, take into account
    whether the prefix being completed starts with `~` or `?`. Change the label
    completions that start with `?` to start with `~` when the prefix being
    completed starts with `~`. (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1277)

  - Fix document syncing (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1278, ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1280, fixes ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1207)

  - Stop generating inlay hints on generated code (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1290)

  - Fix parenthesising of function types in `SignatureHelp` (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1296)

  - Fix syntax documentation rendering (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1318)

- Some additional custom queries, particularly `TypeEnclosing`
- Folding `ifthenelse` expressions
- A new configuration option to control Dune diagnostics
- Improved document symbols

...and many fixes to a handful of issues.
