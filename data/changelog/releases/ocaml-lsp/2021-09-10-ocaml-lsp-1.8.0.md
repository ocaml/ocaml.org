title: Ocaml-lsp 1.8.0
tags: [ocaml-lsp, platform]
changelog: |
  ## Features

  - Add a new code action `Add missing rec keyword`, which is available when
    adding a `rec` keyword can fix `Unbound value ...` error, e.g.,

    ```ocaml
    let fact n = if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1)
                                      (* ^^^^ Unbound value fact *)
    ```

    Adding `rec` to the definition of `fact` will fix the problem. The new code
    action offers adding `rec`.

  - Use ocamlformat to properly format type snippets. This feature requires the
    `ocamlformat-rpc` opam package to be installed. (#386)

  - Add completion support for polymorphic variants, when it is possible to pin
    down the precise type. Examples (`<|>` stands for the cursor) when completion
    will work (#473)

    Function application:

    ```
    let foo (a: [`Alpha | `Beta]) = ()

    foo `A<|>
    ```

    Type explicitly shown:

    ```
    let a : [`Alpha | `Beta] = `B<|>
    ```

    Note: this is actually a bug fix, since we were ignoring the backtick when
    constructing the prefix for completion.

  - Parse merlin errors (best effort) into a more structured form. This allows
    reporting all locations as "related information" (#475)

  - Add support for Merlin `Construct` command as completion suggestions, i.e.,
    show complex expressions that could complete the typed hole. (#472)

  - Add a code action `Construct an expression` that is shown when the cursor is
    at the end of the typed hole, i.e., `_|`, where `|` is the cursor. The code
    action simply triggers the client (currently only VS Code is supported) to
    show completion suggestions. (#472)

  - Change the formatting-on-save error notification to a warning notification
    (#472)

  - Code action to qualify ("put module name in identifiers") and unqualify
    ("remove module name from identifiers") module names in identifiers (#399)

    Starting from:

    ```ocaml
    open Unix

    let times = Unix.times ()
    let f x = x.Unix.tms_stime, x.Unix.tms_utime
    ```

    Calling "remove module name from identifiers" with the cursor on the open
    statement will produce:

    ```ocaml
    open Unix

    let times = times ()
    let f x = x.tms_stime, x.tms_utime
    ```

    Calling "put module name in identifiers" will restore:

    ```ocaml
    open Unix

    let times = Unix.times ()
    let f x = x.Unix.tms_stime, x.Unix.tms_utime
    ```

  ## Fixes

  - Handle workspace change notifications. Previously, the server would only use
    the set of workspaces given at startup to search for workspace symbols. After
    this change, workspace folders that are added later will also be considered.
    (#498)

  - Do not show "random" documentation on hover

    - fixed by [merlin#1364](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1364)
    - fixes duplicate:
      - [ocaml-lsp#344](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/issues/344)
      - [vscode-ocaml-platform#111](https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform/issues/111)

  - Correctly rename a variable used as a named/optional argument (#478)

  - When reporting an error at the beginning of the file, use the first line not
    the second (#489)
