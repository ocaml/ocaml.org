We are pleased to announce the release of OCaml LSP 1.17.0. This version comes packed with fixes and new features.


Notable features that come in this release include:
- Compatibility with Odoc 2.3.0: This version is fully compatible with Odoc 2.3.0, introducing support for the latest syntax features like tables and "codeblock output."
- New Actions for Code Cleanup: You can now mark or remove unused elements such as 'open', types, for loop indexes, modules, match cases, 'rec', and constructors, making your code cleaner and more efficient.
- Auto-completion for 'in' Keyword: To address the long standing issue of the `in` keyword completing to other terms in the editor, we've added auto-completion for this keyword in OCaml LSP. Typing `in` will now only suggest auto completion for the `in` keyword.
