title: Ocaml-lsp 1.7.0
tags: [ocaml-lsp, platform]
changelog: |
  ## Features

  - Add sub-errors as "related" information in diagnostics (#457)

  - Add support for navigating to a symbol inside a workspace (#398)

  - Show typed holes as errors

    Merlin has a concept of "typed holes" that are syntactically represented as `_`. Files
    that incorporate typed holes are not considered valid OCaml, but Merlin and OCaml-LSP
    support them. One example when such typed holes can occur is when on "destructs" a value,
    e.g., destructing `(Some 1)` will generate code `match Some 1 with Some _ -> _ | None -> _`. While the first underscore is a valid "match-all"/wildcard pattern, the rest of
    underscores are typed holes.
