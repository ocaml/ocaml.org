[OBuilder](https://github.com/ocurrent/obuilder/issues/109)
now supports [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) which has allowed
[opam-repo-ci](https://opam.ci.ocaml.org) to be extended to test against
it.  Currently, we are testing Opam 2.1.5 with OCaml 4.14.1 and OCaml
5.0 with FreeBSD 13.2 (AMD64).
