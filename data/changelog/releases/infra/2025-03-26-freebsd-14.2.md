[OBuilder](https://github.com/ocurrent/obuilder) workers for FreeBSD have been updated to FreeBSD 14.2.  See [ocurrent/freebsd-infra](https://github.com/ocurrent/freebsd-infra/commit/e9062f1b5a89bce9b26a1f79d09e88b5477a7f65)

From today, [ocaml-ci](https://ocaml.ci.dev) and [opam-repo-ci](https://opam.ci.ocaml.org) will test against FreeBSD 14.2 rather than 14.1.
