[OBuilder](https://github.com/ocurrent/obuilder) workers for both Intel and Apple Silicon have been updated from macOS Ventura to [macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/) 14.1.1.

From today, [ocaml-ci](https://ocaml.ci.dev) and [opam-repo-ci](https://opam.ci.ocaml.org) will test against Sonoma rather than Ventura.
