    *   merlin binary
        *   Support for OCaml 5.3
        *   Use new 5.3 features to improve locate behavior in some cases. Merlin no  
            longer confuses uids from interfaces and implementations. ([#1857](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1857))
        *   Perform less merges in the indexer ([#1881](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1881))
        *   Add initial support for project-wide renaming: occurrences can now return  
            all usages of all related definitions. ([#1877](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1877))
    *   vim plugin
        *   Added support for search-by-type ([#1846](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1846))  
            This is exposed through the existing `:MerlinSearch` command, that  
            switches between search-by-type and polarity search depending on the  
            first character of the query.

Merlin 5.4-503 is now available with support for OCaml 5.3. This release leverages new features in OCaml 5.3 to improve locate behavior, resolving issues where Merlin previously confused unique identifiers from interfaces and implementations. The indexer has been optimized to perform fewer merges, and initial support for project-wide renaming has been added, allowing occurrences to return all usages of related definitions across a project.

The Vim plugin receives an enhancement with search-by-type functionality, accessible through the existing `:MerlinSearch` command. The command now automatically switches between search-by-type and polarity search based on the first character of the query.
