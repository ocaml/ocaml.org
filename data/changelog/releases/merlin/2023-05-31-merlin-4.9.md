We are pleased to announce the release of Merlin 4.9 for OCaml 4.14.1 and 5.0.

This maintenance release brings multiple bug fixes and improvements. In particular
we identified and patched an important memory consumption issue that could greatly 
affect Merlinâ€™s performance in heavily functorized projects.
