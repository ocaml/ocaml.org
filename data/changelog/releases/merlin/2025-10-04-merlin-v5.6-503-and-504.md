Merlin 5.6 is now available with support for OCaml 5.4, a new type navigation command, and several bug fixes!

### Key Changes

**New `locate-types` command**

The new `locate-types` command returns all locatable type identifiers in an expression as a tree structure. Unlike `locate-type`, which only handles simple type constructors and ignores type arguments, `locate-types` works on complex types like `(int, Foo.t) result`. You can now navigate to `int`, `Foo.t`, or `result` individually. This enables better "Go to Type Definition" functionality in editors that support it.

**OCaml 5.4 support**

This release supports OCaml 5.4.

**Improved error recovery**

Type checking now handles mutually recursive definitions better when they contain errors, providing more useful feedback during development.

**OpenBSD support**

Fixed `merlin_reader` to work correctly on OpenBSD.

**Vim plugin fix**

`:MerlinOccurrencesProjectWide` no longer errors when it can't gather code previews.
