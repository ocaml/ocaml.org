We are pleased to announce the release of Merlin 5.0-502!

This release brings official support for OCaml 5.2. Substantial backend changes were required to adapt to this release, especially for features such as occurrences and get-documentation. Do not hesitate to report any suspicious behavior in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues)!

This release also fixes a handful of issues, two of them improving the behaviour of Merlin's `destruct` feature.
