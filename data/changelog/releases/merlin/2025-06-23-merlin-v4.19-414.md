    *   merlin library
        *   Expose utilities to manipulate typed-holes in `Merlin_analysis.Typed_hole`  
            ([#1888](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1888))
        *   `inlay-hints` fix inlay hints on function parameters ([#1923](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1923))
        *   Handle class type in outline ([#1932](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1932))
        *   Handle locally defined value in outline ([#1936](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1936))
    *   vim plugin
        *   Added support for search-by-type ([#1846](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1846))  
            This is exposed through the existing `:MerlinSearch` command, that  
            switches between search-by-type and polarity search depending on the  
            first character of the query.
