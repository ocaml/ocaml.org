_Feedback on this post is welcomed on [Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-1-1-opam-2-0-10-opam-depext-1-2/8872)!_

We are pleased to announce the release of [opam 2.1.1](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.1).

With opam 2.1.1, if you export `OPAMCLI=2.0` into your environment then workflows expecting opam 2.0 should now behave even more equivalently.

opam 2.1.1 includes both the fixes in opam 2.0.10.

General fixes:

* Restore support for switch creation with "positional" package arguments and `--packages` option for CLI version 2.0, e.g. `OPAMCLI=2.0 opam switch create . 4.12.0+options --packages=ocaml-option-flambda`. In opam 2.1 and later, this syntax remains an error ([#4843](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4843))
* Fix `opam switch set-invariant`: default repositories were loaded instead of the switch's repositories selection ([#4869](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/4869))
* Run the sandbox check in a temporary directory ([#4783](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4783))

Integrated depext support has a few updates:
* Homebrew now has support for casks and full-names ([#4800](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4800))
* Archlinux now handles virtual package detection ([#4833](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/4833), partially addressing [#4759](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4759))
* Disable the detection of available packages on RHEL-based distributions.
  This fixes an issue on RHEL-based distributions where yum list used to detect
  available and installed packages would wait for user input without showing
  any output and/or fail in some cases ([#4791](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/4791))
  
And finally two regressions have been dealt with:
* Regression: avoid calling `Unix.environment` on load (as a toplevel expression). This regression affected opam's libraries, rather than the binary itself ([#4789](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/4789))
* Regression: handle empty environment variable updates ([#4840](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/4840))

A few issues with the compilation of opam from sources have been fixed as well (e.g. mingw-w64 with g++ 11.2 now works)

Opam installation instructions (unchanged):

1. From binaries: run

    ```
    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh) --version 2.1.1"
    ```

    or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.1) to your PATH. In this case, don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update you sandbox script.

2. From source, using opam:

    ```
    opam update; opam install opam-devel
    ```

   (then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained, and don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update your sandbox script)

3. From source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.1.1#compiling-this-repo).

We hope you enjoy this new minor version, and remain open to [bug reports](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues) and [suggestions](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).
