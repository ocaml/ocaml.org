I am *very* happy to announce the first official release of OPAM!

Many of you already know and use OPAM so I won't be long. Please read
[http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2013/01/17/opam-beta.html][opam-beta] for a
longer description.

1.0.0 fixes many bugs and add few new features to the previously announced
beta-release.

The most visible new feature, which should be useful for beginners with
OCaml and OPAM,  is an auto-configuration tool. This tool easily enables all
the features of OPAM (auto-completion, fix the loading of scripts for the
toplevel, opam-switch-eval alias, etc). This tool runs interactively on each
`opam init` invocation. If you don't like OPAM to change your configuration
files, use `opam init --no-setup`. If you trust the tool blindly,  use
`opam init --auto-setup`. You can later review the setup by doing
`opam config setup --list` and call the tool again using `opam config setup`
(and you can of course manually edit your ~/.profile (or ~/.zshrc for zsh
users), ~/.ocamlinit and ~/.opam/opam-init/*).

## Install ##

Packages for Debian and OSX (at least homebrew) should follow shortly and
I'm looking for volunteers to create and maintain rpm packages. The binary
installer is up-to-date for Linux and Darwin 64-bit architectures, the
32-bit version for Linux should arrive shortly.

If you want to build from sources, the full archive (including dependencies)
is available here:

  http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam-full-latest.tar.gz

### Upgrade ###

If you are upgrading from 0.9.* you won't  have anything special to do apart
installing the new binary. You can then update your package metadata by
running `opam update`. If you want to use the auto-setup feature, remove the
"eval `opam config env` line you have previously added in your ~/.profile
and run `opam config setup --all`.

So everything should be fine. But you never know ... so if something goes
horribly wrong in the upgrade process (of if your are upgrading from an old
version of OPAM) you can still trash your ~/.opam, manually remove what OPAM
added in  your ~/.profile (~/.zshrc for zsh users) and ~/.ocamlinit, and
start again from scratch.
