 * macOS sandbox script always mounts `/tmp` read-write, regardless of `TMPDIR` [[#3742](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/3742), addressing [ocaml/opam-repository#13339](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/13339)]
 * `pre-` and `post-session` hooks can now print to the console [[#4359](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4359)]
 * Switch-specific pre/post sessions hooks are now actually run [[#4472](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/4472)]

Installation instructions (unchanged):

1. From binaries: run

    ```
    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh) --version 2.0.8"
    ```

    or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.8) to your PATH. In this case, don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update you sandbox script.

2. From source, using opam:

    ```
    opam update; opam install opam-devel
    ```

   (then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained, and don't forget to run `opam init --reinit -ni` to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed or to update you sandbox script)

3. From source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.0.8#compiling-this-repo).

We hope you enjoy this new minor version, and remain open to [bug reports](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues) and [suggestions](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).
