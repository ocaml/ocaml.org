    ## Changes

    ### Install of dependencies `--deps-only`

    #### Behaviour

    *   ◈ Change the behaviour of `--deps-only`, where it no longer requires unicity of package version between the request and the installed packages. In other words, if you have `pkg.1` installed, installing dependencies of `pkg.2` no longer removes `pkg.1`. This also allows to install dependencies of conflicting packages when their dependencies are compliant. \[[#6520](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6520) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou)\]

    #### Fixes

    Fixed some bugs in `opam install --deps-only` (and other commands simulating package pins, such as `--depext-only`) more visible in 2.4:

    *   When a package `pkg` is already installed and `opam install ./pkg --deps` is called, if there is a conflict between the installed `pkg` dependencies and the definition of the local `pkg`, the conflict was not seen and the already installed `pkg` was kept \[[#6530](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6530) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou) - fix [#6529](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6529)\]
    *   No longer fetch and write the sources when simulating packages that were already pinned \[[#6533](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6533) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou) - fix [#6532](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6532)\]
    *   opam was triggering the reinstall of the package based on the already pinned packages instead of the expected newly simulated pinned packages \[[#6522](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6522) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou) - partial fix [#6501](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6501)\]
    *   opam was using the opam description of the wrong package in some cases \[[#6544](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6544) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate) - fix [#6535](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6535)\]

    ### Reinstall

    *   Fix a regression where the internal `sources` directory was removed unexpectedly on reinstall actions, making opam re-fetch the package \[[#6550](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6550) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou) - fix [#6551](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6551)\]

    ### Update

    Fixed a couple of regressions in `opam update`:

    *   An unexpected stack overflow exception was raised when updating repositories with large files when opam is compiled with OCaml < `5.1` \[[#6527](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6527) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate) - fix [#6513](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6513)\]
    *   Updating a repository where a line was added at the end of a file without final newline character was making the update fail \[[#6527](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6527) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate) - fix [hannesm/patch#28](https://github.com/hannesm/patch/issues/28)\]

    ### Windows

    *   Improve the prebuilt Windows binaries by including Cygwin's `setup-x86_64.exe` in the binary itself as fallback, in case `cygwin.com` is inaccessible \[[#6538](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6538) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate)\]

    ### Build changes

    *   Bump the downloaded-if-missing `dune` to `3.19.0`, `cppo` to `1.8.0`, `ocamlgraph` to `2.2.0`, `uutf` to `1.0.4` and `patch` to `3.0.0~beta1` \[[#6527](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6527) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate)\]
    *   Allows `./configure --without-dune` to build with OCaml `5.4` \[[#6527](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6527) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate)\]
    *   Add a `--with-cygwin-setup` option to the `configure` script, only available on Windows and disabled by default, which includes the optionally given `setup-x86_64.exe` binary inside the opam binary. If the option is given without a filename, the file with be fetched from `cygwin.com` \[[#6526](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6526) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate) [@dra27](https://github.com/dra27) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou) - fix [#6498](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6498)\]

    ### Testing and documentation

    *   Improve and extend the testsuite \[[#6530](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6530) [#6533](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6533) [#6539](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6539) [#6544](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6544) [#6550](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6550) [#6520](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6520) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate)\]
    *   Improve and extend the test infrastructure \[[#6524](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6524) [#6553](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6553) [#6549](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6549) [@kit-ty-kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou)\]

    ## API updates

    ### opam-client

    *   `OpamAction.cleanup_artefacts`: no longer removes the internal `sources` directory if the package is installed but not pinned \[[#6550](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/6550) [@rjbou](https://github.com/rjbou)\]
