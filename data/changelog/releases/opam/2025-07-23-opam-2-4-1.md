_Feedback on this post is welcomed on [Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-4-1/17002)!_

We are pleased to announce the release of opam 2.4.1 fixing a regression affecting some uses of `pin-depends`, and encourage all users to upgrade.
Please read on for installation and upgrade instructions.

## Changes

* Fix `pin-depends` being ignored with `opam install --deps-only` ([#6610](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6610))

This release also extends the tests.


## Try it!

The upgrade instructions are unchanged:

1. Either from binaries: run

For Unix systems
```
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh) --version 2.4.1"
```
or from PowerShell for Windows systems
```
Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://opam.ocaml.org/install.ps1) } -Version 2.4.1"
```
or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.4.1) to your PATH.

2. Or from source, manually: see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.4.1#compiling-this-repo).


You should then run:
```
opam init --reinit -ni
```


Please report any issues to [the bug-tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues).

Happy hacking!
