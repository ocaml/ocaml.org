title: Mdx 2.0.0
date: "2021-12-15"
tags: [mdx, platform]
changelog: |
  #### Added

  - Add trailing `;;` to the output of toplevel phrases that were missing it.
    (#346, @Leonidas-from-XIV)
  - Make MDX compatible with OCaml 4.14 (#356, @NathanReb)

  #### Fixed

  - Use the same output as the normal toplevel. Mdx used to carry an unsafe patch
    to work around a bug fixed in OCaml 4.06 and that patch would change the
    printed types in some corner cases. (#322, @emillon)

  #### Removed

  - Dropped compatibility with older OCaml versions. The minimal supported range
    is 4.08 to 4.13 now (#345, @Leonidas-from-XIV)
  - Do not install deprecated `mdx` binary anymore (#274, @gpetiot)
  - Remove deprecated `rule` command (#312, @gpetiot)
  - Remove support for `require-package` label, use the `mdx` stanza in dune
    instead. This label was only used for the `rule` command and can now be
    safely removed. (#363, @Leonidas-from-XIV)
