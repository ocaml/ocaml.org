title: Mdx 2.3.0
tags: [mdx, platform]
changelog: |
  #### Added

  - Added support for `mld` files (#423, @jonludlam)

  #### Changed

  - Switch to using the parser that toplevel uses (found in a mutable
  `ref`, instead of always the official OCaml parser).  This allows
  Camlp5's parser to be used with MDX. (#417, @chetmurthy)

We're pleased to announce the release of Mdx 2.3.0!

This release comes with support for `mld` files and changes the parser used
by the toplevel, which allows Camlp5's parser to be used with MDX.

## ðŸŒŸ Spotlight Feature

Starting in MDX 2.3.0, you can now execute code blocks in your `.mld` files! ðŸŽ‰

As a reminder, `.mld` files are text files similar to Markdown, but instead of
using the Markdown markup language, they use the Ocamldoc markdown language - as
is used in `.mli` files. `.mld` are typically used to write manuals with
[odoc](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/).

To run mdx on `.mld` files, start by enabling `mdx` in your `dune-project`:

```
(using mdx 0.3)
```

Then list your `.mld` files in the `mdx` stanza in your `dune`:

```
(mdx
 (files index.mld))
```

Now if you put a code block in `index.mld`, it will be executed when running `dune test` and if dune will suggest to promote the output. For instance, if you run `dune test` with this `index.mld`:

```
Here's an example code block in a [.mld] file:

{[
  # List.map (fun x -> x * x) [(1 + 9); 2; 3; 4];;
]}
```

`dune test` will return:

```diff
diff --git a/_build/default/index.mld b/_build/default/.mdx/index.mld.corrected
index 337b042..c29bb63 100644

You can run `dune promote` to accept the change.

You can see a complete demo of this [here](https://github.com/tmattio/demo-mdx-mld).

Now you can keep the code blocks in your manual up-to-date even when your API
changes!
