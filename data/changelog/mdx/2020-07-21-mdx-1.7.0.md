title: Mdx 1.7.0
date: "2020-07-21"
tags: [mdx, platform]
changelog: |
  #### Added

  - HTML comments can carry block labels (#234, @gpetiot)
    The syntax is: `<!-- $MDX labels -->`, where `labels` is a list of valid
    labels separated by a comma. This line has to immediately precede the block
    it is attached to. The legacy syntax is preserved and will be deprecated in a
    later release.
  - Add support for toplevel blocks in `.mli` files' doc comments (#206, @jsomers)
  - Add support for OCaml 4.11 (#261, @kit-ty-kate)

  #### Changed

  - Apply unnamed preludes to all environments (#271, @gpetiot)
    New behavior:
    * `env_and_file "a:f"` associates `f` to the environment named `a`
    * `env_and_file " :f"` associates `f` to the default environment
    * `env_and_file "f"` associates `f` to all environments.
  - Errors in non toplevel OCaml blocks are now printed to a seperate `mdx-error` code block
    following the ocaml block instead of crashing the mdx process. Those `mdx-error` blocks
    are recognized and checked by mdx and can be intentionally used to show case specific
    compile errors. (#238, @gpetiot)
  - Improve error reporting for invalid `(* $MDX part-... *)` delimiters (#250, @gpetiot)

  #### Deprecated

  - The command 'mdx rule' is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.0 (#251, @gpetiot)

  #### Fixed

  - Fix the environment selection for preludes and slightly improve quality
    of type names in evaluations of toplevel phrases in certain cases. (#225, @gpetiot)
  - Fix toplevel parsing when phrases contain tabs (#240, @gpetiot)
  - Avoid adding newlines to empty blocks (#253, @gpetiot)
  - Preserve the indentation of included files (#259, @gpetiot)
  - Preserve the header in shell blocks (#249, @craigfe)
  - Support underscores in environment variables in `set-` and `unset-` labels (#257, @shonfeder)
  - Fix mdx on Windows which was looking for the ocaml-mdx-test binary at the wrong place
    (#263, @hcarty)
  - Properly report mdx parsing errors instead of crashing with an uncaught exception (#267, @gpetiot)
