(* In order to encode a URI, we use the `Uri.make` function whose parameters are all optional (except the `()` at the end). *)
let uri =
  Uri.make
    ~scheme:"https"
    ~userinfo:"login:password"
    ~host:"ocaml.org"
    ~port:8080
    ~path:"/search"
    ~query:["param1",["a";"b"];"param2",["déjà "]]
    ~fragment:"anchor"
    ()
let () =
  assert (Uri.to_string uri
           = "https://login:password@ocaml.org:8080/search?param1=a,b&param2=d%C3%A9j%C3%A0%20#anchor")

(* A different approach is to start with a known URI and change some of its components.

  The following functions are available: `with_scheme`, `with_userinfo`,
  `with_password`, `with_port`, `with_path`, `with_query`, and `with_fragment`.

  Except for `with_path` and `with_query`, all of them take an `option` type parameter
  in order to allow removing that specific component from the URI.

  Note: these functions have a first parameter, which is the URI to modify,
  and a second that contains the corresponding field's new value. *)
let uri = Uri.of_string "https://ocaml.org/"

let uri' = uri
  |> Fun.flip Uri.with_path "/search"
  |> Fun.flip Uri.with_port (Some 8080)
  |> Fun.flip Uri.with_userinfo (Some "user:password")
  |> Fun.flip Uri.with_query ["param1", ["42"]]

(* We can also add parameters, one by one or from a list *)
let uri'' = Uri.add_query_param uri' ("param2",["**"])
let uri''' = Uri.add_query_params uri'' ["param3",["?"];"param4",["&"]]
