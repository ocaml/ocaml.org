  The main [Cmdliner docs](https://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner/doc/index.html)
  offer a quick tutorial, guides to how the parsing and man-page construction
  works as well as example parsers and links to API docs.

(* The Cmdliner package offers a sophisticated compositional way of handling
   command-line parsing. It handles options, positional arguments and
   sub-commands. It will automatically generate help and a man-page.

   The core of our application in this recipe is the `greeter` function -
   Cmdliner will call this for us.

   For `num_repeats` we want an optional integer (with a default of 1)

   For the `names` we want all the positional arguments in a list.

   The top-level `Term` of our parser-definition combines the function to call
   along with the arguments to parse.

   The `cmd` represents the body of our application.

   Try to parse the command-line and call "greeter" if successful. If not,
   prints formatted help-text and returns a non-zero exit code.
