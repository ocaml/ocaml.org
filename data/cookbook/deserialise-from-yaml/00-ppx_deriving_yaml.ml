  - The `yaml` package provides means to parse and print YAML source into a generic type: `Yaml.value`
  - The `ppx_deriving_yaml` package provides means to convert to and from `Yaml.value` into custom record types.
  - If both serialising and deserialising are needed, the attribute `of_yaml` can be replaced by `yaml`.
  - Package `ppx_deriving_yaml` depends on `yaml`, you only needs to require the former.

(** The syntax `{yaml| ... |yaml}` is a quoted string. The `yaml` identifier has
  no meaning, it is informative only needs to be the same at both ends. No escaping
  is needed inside a quoted string. In a “real-world” example, the YAML source
  would be read from a file or received from a network request, this is out of the
  scope of this recipe.

  In production code, it may make sense to replace `Yaml.Util.map_exn` by
  `Yaml.Util.map` which returns a `Result.Error` instead of throwing an
  exception. This would require some extra plumbing code. *)

       `O [("name", `String name)];
       `O [("ingredients", `A ingredients)];

(** Everything is combined: parsing, post-processing and conversion into custom
  record types. The function `Yaml.of_string` is provided by the `yaml` package.
  Since `Yaml.of_string` returns a `result` wrapped value, post-processing must
  take place under a call to `Result.map`. Since `recipe_of_yaml` also returns a
  `result` wrapped value, it must be called using `Result.bind` which does the
  same as `Result.bind` except it peels-off the double `result` wrapping. Refer
  to the [Error Handling](/docs/error-handling) guide for more on processing
  `result` values. `Fun.flip` is a artefact needed by type-cheking, otherwise
  `Result.bind` does not expect its arguments in the order required by this
  pipe. *)
