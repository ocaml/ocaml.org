OCaml 2017 will open with an invited talk by three frequent
contributors that recently became maintainers of the OCaml
implementation: David Allsopp
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10OQHsnyg64&index=2&list=TLGGpj_CrU7rr7MxMjAxMjAxOA)),
Florian Angeletti
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOfdGDSypP4&list=TLGGpj_CrU7rr7MxMjAxMjAxOA&index=5)),
and Sébastien Hinderer
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvnyQWZkHS8&list=TLGGpj_CrU7rr7MxMjAxMjAxOA&index=1)).

Due to the high number of high-quality submissions, we had to have
more posters than in previous editions to fit a one-day
schedule. 


The following works will be presented as posters.

- _ocamli: Interpreted OCaml_ —
  John Whitington  
  [extended abstract](http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/jw642/ocamlworkshop.pdf)
  ([local copy](extended-abstract__2017__john_whitington__ocamli-interpreted-ocaml.pdf))

- _mSAT: An OCaml SAT Solver_ —
  Bury Guillaume  
  [extended abstract](https://gbury.eu/public/papers/icfp2017_msat.pdf)
  ([local copy](extended-abstract__2017__guillaume-bury__msat-an-ocaml-sat-solver.pdf))

- _Tyre – Typed Regular Expressions_ —
  Gabriel Radanne  
  ([extended abstract](https://www.irif.fr/~gradanne/papers/tyre/abstract.pdf)
   ([local copy](extended-abstract__2017__gabriel-radanne__tyre-typed-regular-expressions.pdf)))

- _Jbuilder: a modern approach to OCaml development_ —
  Jeremie Dimino, Mark Shinwell  
  ([local copy](extended-abstract__2017__jeremie-dimino_mark-shinwell__jbuilder-a-modern-approach-to-ocaml-development.pdf))


## Call for presentations (past)

### Scope

Presentations and discussions will focus on the OCaml
programming language and its community. We aim to solicit talks
on all aspects related to improving the use or development of
the language and its programming environment, including, for
example (but not limited to):

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not
  limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,
  or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design
  rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or
  deployments in unusual situations.

### Presentations

It will be an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The
presentation material will be available online from the workshop
homepage. The presentations may be recorded, and made available
at a later time.

The main presentation format is a workshop talk, traditionally
around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, but we also
have a poster session during the workshop -- this allows to
present more diverse work, and gives time for discussion. The
program committee will decide which presentations should be
delivered as posters or talks.

### Submission

To submit a presentation, please register a description of the
talk (about 2 pages long) at <https://icfp-ocaml17.hotcrp.com/>
providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the
presentation: the problems that are addressed, the solutions or
methods that are proposed.

LaTeX-produced PDFs are a common and welcome submission
format. For accessibility purposes, we ask PDF submitters to
also provide the sources of their submission in a textual
format, such as .tex sources. Reviewers may read either the
submitted PDF or the text version.

### ML family workshop and post-proceedings

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with
general issues of the ML-style programming and type systems,
focuses on more research-oriented work that is less specific to
a language in particular (OCaml). There is an overlap between
the two workshops, and we have occasionally transferred
presentations from one to the other in the past. The authors who
feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to
mention it at submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

We are planning to publish combined post-proceedings and to
invite interested authors of selected presentations to expand
their abstracts for inclusion.


### Questions and contact

Please send any questions to the chair:
