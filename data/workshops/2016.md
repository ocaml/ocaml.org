### Scope

Presentations and discussions will focus on the OCaml
programming language and its community. We aim to solicit talks
on all aspects related to improving the use or development of
the language and its programming environment, including, for
example (but not limited to):

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not
  limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,
  or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design
  rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or
  deployments in unusual situations.

### Presentations

It will be an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The
presentation material will be available online from the workshop
homepage. The presentations may be recorded, and made available
at a later time.

The main presentation format is a workshop talk, traditionally
around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, but we also
have a poster session during the workshop -- this allows to
present more diverse work, and gives time for discussion. The
program committee will decide which presentations should be
delivered as posters or talks.

### Submission

To submit a presentation, please register a description of the
talk (about 2 pages long) at <https://icfp-ocaml17.hotcrp.com/>
providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the
presentation: the problems that are addressed, the solutions or
methods that are proposed. If you wish to perform a demo or require any special setup, we will do our best to accommodate you.

LaTeX-produced PDFs are a common and welcome submission
format. For accessibility purposes, we ask PDF submitters to
also provide the sources of their submission in a textual
format, such as .tex sources. Reviewers may read either the
submitted PDF or the text version.

### ML family workshop and post-proceedings

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with general issues of the ML-style programming and  poster systems, and is seen as more research-oriented. Yet there is an overlap with the OCaml workshop, which we are keen to explore, for instance by having a common session. The authors who feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to mention it at submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

There may be a combined post-conference proceedings of selected papers from the two workshops.
