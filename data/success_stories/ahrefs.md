## Challenge

Ahrefs has always been committed to operational efficiency and self-reliance, even as it grew to become a leader in the SEO industry. Unlike many VC-funded companies, Ahrefs has chosen to prioritize maintaining a small, focused team while achieving exceptional output. However, this approach came with its own set of challenges.


One major challenge was maintaining high-quality standards across the codebase. Ahrefs needed a cohesive and type-safe technology stack that worked seamlessly across the frontend and backend, enabling developers to write reliable code with confidence and ensuring a consistent, high-quality output.

Another challenge was scaling operations. The lack of a integration between the different bricks often required teams to wait on one another, needing collaboration to create APIs, leading to delays and inefficiencies in delivering features. The team was looking for a unified stack, empowering all engineers to contribute to any part of the stack, reducing bottlenecks, increasing ownership and business knowledge, while maintaining a high trust in the final result.

## Result

Adopting OCaml was a transformative decision for Ahrefs, enabling the company to overcome its challenges and significantly improve operations. By transitioning the entire frontend team from PHP and jQuery to OCaml, supported by Melange and React, Ahrefs achieved a full-stack evolution.

One of the most impactful outcomes was the ability to share data types between the frontend and backend. This streamlined development processes, reduced friction, and allowed engineers to contribute meaningfully across the entire stack. With this new technology foundation, Ahrefs not only maintained but significantly scaled its operations.

Today, Ahrefs’ systems handle **millions of frontend requests per day** and process **billions of backend requests per day**. The codebase powering this scale has grown to **1.5 million lines of OCaml code**, underscoring the robustness and scalability of their technology stack. These advancements have helped Ahrefs become a trusted industry leader, relied upon by **44% of Fortune 500 companies**.

## Why OCaml

Ahrefs chose OCaml as the backbone of its technology stack because of its unique ability to combine expressiveness and reliability. The language allowed developers to write concise, efficient code that remained stable over the long term, with systems often running for years without surprises.

One of the key reasons for selecting OCaml was its versatility in enabling a unified technology stack. The ability to use shared types between frontend and backend eliminated redundant work, improved collaboration, and ensured consistency across the board. Additionally, OCaml’s robust type system provided engineers with a high degree of confidence in their code, significantly reducing errors and simplifying maintenance.

OCaml’s ecosystem, especially with the introduction of Melange (formerly BuckleScript), allowed Ahrefs to bridge the gap between OCaml’s strong typing and the flexibility of the JavaScript ecosystem. Initially adopted for crawling and data processing, OCaml’s utility expanded to the frontend when Melange made it possible to compile OCaml to JavaScript. This decision empowered Ahrefs to create tools that made their vast datasets more accessible and actionable.

## Solution

OCaml addresses Ahrefs’ challenges, providing the tools needed to build a cohesive, scalable, and efficient technology stack. One of the most impactful features was its end-to-end type safety. Using tools like ATD, Ahrefs generated shared types for both frontend and backend development, ensuring consistency and reducing the likelihood of bugs.

OCaml’s expressiveness allows Ahrefs to avoid relying on bloated, one-size-fits-all frameworks. Instead, the team could craft solutions tailored to their specific needs, resulting in more efficient and maintainable systems. This customization extended to their tech stack, which seamlessly integrated OCaml with complementary technologies like Melange, React, Clickhouse, MySQL, and Elasticsearch.

The unified OCaml stack also fosters a more collaborative environment. By allowing all engineers to contribute across domains, Ahrefs broke down silos and improved overall productivity. The result was a streamlined development process that enabled the company to maintain high standards of output while keeping its team small and focused.

## Lessons Learned

Ahrefs’ journey with OCaml provides valuable insights for other companies considering a similar path:

1. **Embrace Simplicity:** OCaml’s type system is intuitive yet powerful, enabling developers to build expressive and reliable applications without unnecessary complexity.
2. **Invest in Learning:** Training the team in OCaml is essential but rewarding. Tools like the Melange playground can make the onboarding process smoother and more approachable.
3. **Build Tailored Solutions:** By leveraging OCaml’s expressiveness, Ahrefs avoided generic frameworks in favor of custom-built solutions that addressed their unique needs. While this approach requires more ownership, it results in greater efficiency and precision.
4. **You Will need to Write Bindings:** Writing bindings can be complex, but resources from the community simplify this process.
5. **Adopt Gradually:** Starting with small contributions to libraries or limited integrations can help teams build confidence before transitioning fully to OCaml.
