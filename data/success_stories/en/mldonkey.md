[MLdonkey](http://mldonkey.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) is a
multi-platform multi-networks peer-to-peer client. It was the first
open-source client to access the eDonkey network. Today, MLdonkey
supports several other large networks, among which Overnet, Bittorrent,
Gnutella, Gnutella2, Fasttrack, Soulseek, Direct-Connect, and Opennap.
Searches can be conducted over several networks concurrently; files are
downloaded from and uploaded to multiple peers concurrently.

*An MLdonkey developer says:* “Early in 2002, we decided to use OCaml to
program a network application in the emerging world of peer-to-peer
systems. The result of our work, MLdonkey, has surpassed our hopes:
MLdonkey is currently the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing client
according to [free(code)](http://freecode.com/) (formerly “freshmeat.net”),
with about 10,000
daily users. Moreover, MLdonkey is the only client able to connect to
several peer-to-peer networks, to download and share files. It works as
a daemon, running unattended on the computer, and can be controlled
remotely using a choice of three different kinds of interfaces: GTK, web
and telnet.”
