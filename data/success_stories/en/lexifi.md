Developed by the company [LexiFi](https://www.lexifi.com/), the Modeling
Language for Finance (MLFi) is the first formal language that accurately
describes the most sophisticated capital market, credit, and investment
products. MLFi is implemented as an extension of OCaml.

MLFi users derive two important benefits from a functional programming
approach. First, the declarative formalism of functional programming
languages is well suited for *specifying* complex data structures and
algorithms. Second, functional programming languages have strong *list
processing* capabilities. Lists play a central role in finance where
they are used extensively to define contract event and payment
schedules.

In addition, MLFi provides crucial business integration capabilities
inherited from OCaml and related tools and libraries. This enables
users, for example, to interoperate with C and Java programs, manipulate
XML schemas and documents, and interface with SQL databases.

Data models and object models aiming to encapsulate the definitions and
behavior of financial instruments were developed by the banking industry
over the past two decades, but face inherent limitations that OCaml
helped overcome.

LexiFi's approach to modeling complex financial contracts received an
academic award in 2000, and the MLFi implementation was elected
“Software Product of the Year 2001” by the magazine *Risk*, the leading
financial trading and risk management publication. MLFi-based solutions
are gaining growing acceptance throughout Europe and are contributing to
spread the use of OCaml in the financial services industry.
