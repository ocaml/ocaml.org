Jane Street is a proprietary trading firm that uses OCaml as its primary
development platform.  Our operation runs at a large scale,
generating billions of dollars of transactions every day from our offices
in Hong Kong, London and New York, with strategies that span many asset classes,
time-zones and regulatory regimes.

Almost all of our software is written in OCaml, from statistical
research code to systems-administration tools to our real-time trading
infrastructure.  OCamlâ€™s type system acts as a rich and
well-integrated set of static analysis tools that help improve the
quality of our code, catching bugs at the earliest possible stage.
Billions of dollars of transactions flow through our systems every day,
so getting it right matters.  At the same time, OCaml is highly productive,
helping us quickly adapt to changing market conditions.

Jane Street has been contributing open-source libraries back to the wider
community for many years, including Core, our alternative standard
library, Async, a cooperative concurrency library,
and several syntax extensions like binprot and sexplib.  All of these can
be found at [https://janestreet.github.io](https://janestreet.github.io).  All in, we've open-sourced
more than 200k lines of code.
