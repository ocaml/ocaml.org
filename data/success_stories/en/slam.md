The [SLAM](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/) project
originated in Microsoft Research in early 2000. Its goal was to
automatically check that a C program correctly uses the interface to an
external library. The project used and extended ideas from symbolic
model checking, program analysis and theorem proving in novel ways to
address this problem. The SLAM analysis engine forms the core of a new
tool called Static Driver Verifier (SDV) that systematically analyzes
the source code of Windows device drivers against a set of rules that
define what it means for a device driver to properly interact with the
Windows operating system kernel.

T.Ball, B.Cook, V.Levin and S.K.Rajamani, the SLAM developers, write:*
“The Right Tools for the Job: We developed SLAM using Inria's OCaml
functional programming language. The expressiveness of this language and
robustness of its implementation provided a great productivity boost.”
