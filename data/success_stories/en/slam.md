---

The [SLAM](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/) project originated in Microsoft Research in early 2000. Its goal was to automatically check that a C program correctly uses the interface to an external library. The project used and extended ideas from symbolic model checking, program analysis and theorem proving in novel ways to address this problem. The SLAM analysis engine forms the core of a new tool called Static Driver Verifier (SDV) that systematically analyzes the source code of Windows device drivers against a set of rules that define what it means for a device driver to properly interact with the Windows operating system kernel.

*In technical report MSR-TR-2004-08, T.Ball, B.Cook, V.Levin and S.K.Rajamani, the SLAM developers, write:* “The Right Tools for the Job: We developed SLAM using Inria's OCaml functional programming language. The expressiveness of this language and robustness of its implementation provided a great productivity boost.”
