*[David Monniaux](https://www-verimag.imag.fr/~monniaux/) (CNRS), member
of the ASTRÉE project, says:* “[ASTRÉE](https://www.astree.ens.fr/) is a
*static analyzer* based on *[abstract
interpretation](https://www.di.ens.fr/%7Ecousot/aiintro.shtml)* that aims
at proving the absence of runtime errors in safety-critical software
written in a subset of the C programming language.”

“Automatically analyzing programs for exactly checking properties such
as the absence of runtime errors is impossible in general, for
mathematical reasons. Static analysis by abstract interpretation works
around this impossibility and proves program properties by
over-approximating the possible behaviors of the program: it is possible
to design pessimistic approximations that, in practice, allow proving
the desired property on a wide range of software.”

“So far, ASTRÉE has proved the absence of runtime errors in the primary
control software of the [Airbus A340
family](https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/previous-generation-aircraft/a340-family.html). This
would be impossible by *software testing*, for testing only considers a
limited *subset* of the test cases, while abstract interpretation
considers a *superset* of all possible outcomes of the system.”

“[ASTRÉE](https://www.astree.ens.fr/) is written in OCaml and is about
44000 lines long (plus external libraries). We needed a language with
good performance (speed and memory usage) on reasonable equipment, easy
support for advanced data structures, and type and memory safety. OCaml
also allows for modular, clear and compact source code and makes it easy
to work with recursive structures such as syntax trees.”
