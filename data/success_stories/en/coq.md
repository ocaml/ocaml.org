*[Jean-Christophe Filliâtre](https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/) (CNRS), a
Coq developer, says:* “The [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) tool is a system
for manipulating formal mathematical proofs; a proof carried out in Coq
is mechanically verified by the machine. In addition to its applications
in mathematics, Coq also allows certifying the correctness of computer
programs.”

“From the Coq standpoint, OCaml is attractive on multiple grounds.
First, the OCaml language is perfectly suited for symbolic
manipulations, which are of paramount importance in a proof assistant.
Furthermore, OCaml's type system, and particularly its notion of
abstract type, allow securely encapsulating Coq's critical code base,
which guarantees the logical consistency of the whole system. Last,
OCaml's strong type system *de facto* grants Coq's code a high level of
quality: errors such as “segmentation faults” cannot occur during
execution, which is indispensable for a tool whose primary goal is
precisely rigor.”
