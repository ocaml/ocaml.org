Jane Street, an exclusive trading firm with offices in London, New York, and Hong Kong, chose OCaml for their primary development platform because its rich and well-integrated set of static analysis tools improve the quality of their code and catch bugs early. 

They use OCaml-based software for statistical research code, sysadmin tools, and real-time trading infrastructure. This ecosystem enables them to generate billions of dollars of transactions each day, spanning many asset classes and regulatory regimes. Since OCaml is highly adaptable, they’re able to quickly adapt to the ever-changing market conditions. On average, their trading represents between 1% and 2% of the total US equity volume.

Jane Street has contributed over 200,000 lines of code to open-source libraries, which benefits the entire community. They’ve worked on Core, their alternative standard library, Async, a cooperative concurrency library, and several syntax extensions, like bin_prot and sexplib, all based on OCaml(https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/v0.12/doc/). These and more can be found on their website(http://janestreet.github.io). 

## Challenge

For the past 20+ years, Jane Street has used OCaml as their single-tool solution. When deciding on a solution, they wanted something that was fast yet efficient, caught bugs early, and that they could use across the company.

## Solution

Since Jane Street runs big trading systems to trade billions of dollars everyday, so it’s important to get it right. They needed a customisable tool that could handle the quantity with as few errors as possible, efficiently. They found that OCaml gave them the best of compiled and dynamic languages, all in one tool. It's concise like dynamic languages, and it's also efficient like compiled languages. OCaml compilers run along with the code, while it's being written, so they're extremely fast. OCaml was the perfect solution from running little scripts for automated tasks to operating their huge trading systems—and everything in between.

## Results

By using a single tool across their company, they found that productivity was also more efficient because they didn't have the problem of one programmer hesitant to touch something that was (for example) in C++ when they felt more confident in Python. OCaml streamlined the coding process and brought teams closer. With OCaml, small teams have the ability to work on massive infrastructure, which maximised productivity. Plus, it attracts only the best programmers who are passionate about functional languages, especially OCaml, which simplifies the hiring process. 

OCaml helps them quickly adapt to changing market conditions, and go from prototypes to production systems with less effort.
