    description: In this talk, we present our work on a syntax definition for the
      OCaml language in the syntax definition formalism SDF3. SDF3 supports the
      high-level definition of concrete and abstract syntax through declarative
      disambiguation and definition of constructors, enabling a direct mapping
      to abstract syntax. Based on the SDF3 syntax definition, the Spoofax
      language workbench produces a complete syntax aware editor with a parser,
      syntax checking, parse error recovery, syntax highlighting, formatting
      with correct parenthesis insertion, and syntactic completion. The syntax
      definition should provide a good basis for experiments with the design of
      OCaml and the development of further tooling. In the talk, we will
      highlight interesting aspects of the syntax definition, discuss issues we
      encountered in the syntax of OCaml, and demonstrate the editor.

    description: "Rendering OCaml document is widely known as a very difficult task:
      The ever-evolving OCaml module system is extremely rich and can include
      complex set of inter-dependencies that are both difficult to compute and
      to render in a concise document. Its tasks are even harder than the
      typechecker as it also needs to keep track of documentation comments
      precisely and efficiently. As an example, signatures such as include
      F(X).T and destructive substitutions were never handled properly by any
      documentation generator."

    description: OCaml-CI is a CI service for OCaml projects. It uses metadata from
      the project’s Opam and Dune files to work out what to build, and uses
      caching to make builds fast. It automatically tests projects against
      multiple OCaml versions and OS platforms. The CI has been deployed on
      around 50 projects so far on GitHub, and many of them see response times
      an order of magnitude quicker than with less integrated CI solutions. This
      talk will introduce the CI service and then look at some of the
      technologies used to build it.

    description: Coda is a new cryptocurrency that uses zk-SNARKs to dramatically
      reduce the size of data needed by nodes running its protocol. Nodes
      communicate in a format automatically derived from type definitions in
      OCaml source files. As the Coda software evolves, these formats for sent
      data may change. We wish to allow nodes running older versions of the
      software to communicate with newer versions. To achieve that, we identify
      stable types that must not change over time, so that their serializations
      also do not change.

    description: SmartPy is a complete system to develop smart-contracts for the
      Tezos blockchain. It is an embedded EDSL in python to write contracts and
      their test scenarios. It includes an online IDE, a chain explorer, and a
      command-line interface. Python is used to generate programs in an
      imperative, type-inferred, intermediate language called SmartML. SmartML
      is also the name of the OCaml library which provides an interpreter, a
      compiler to Michelson (the smart-contract language of Tezos), as well as a
      scenario “on-chain” interpreter. The IDE uses a mix of OCaml built with
      js_of_ocaml and pure Javascript. The command-line interface also builds
      with js_of_ocaml to run on Node.js.

    description: OCaml programmers make deliberate use of abstract data types for
      composing safe and reliable software systems. The OCaml compiler relies on
      the invariants imposed by the type system to produce efficient and compact
      runtime data representations. Being no longer relevant, the type
      information is discarded after compilation. The resulting performance is a
      key feature of the OCaml language.

    description: This proposal describes a presentation to be given at the OCaml’20
      workshop. The presentation will cover a new OCaml filesystem, ImpFS, and
      the related libraries. The filesystem makes use of a B-tree library
      presented at OCaml’17, and a key-value store presented at ML’19. In
      addition, there are a number of other support libraries that may be of
      interest to the community. ImpFS represents a single point in the
      filesystem design space, but we hope that the libraries we have developed
      will enable others to build further filesystems with novel features.

      extensively used by major software projects over the past few years such
      as Docker for Mac/Windows, and noticeably through DataKit, which powers
      hundreds of thousands monthly builds on the `opam-repository` CI
      contributors may be familiar with."

    description: >-
      AD-OCaml is a library framework for calculating mathematically exact
      derivatives and deep power series approximations of almost arbitrary OCaml
      programs via algorithmic differentiation. Unlike similar frameworks, this
      includes programs with side effects, aliasing, and programs with nested
      derivative operators. The framework also offers implicit parallelization
      of both user programs and their transformations.


      The presentation will provide a short introduction to the mathematical problem, the difficulties of implementing a solution, the design of the library, and a demonstration of its capabilities.

    description: In this talk we describe our experience in using an automatic
      API-migration strategy dedicated at changing the signatures of OCaml
      functions, using the Rotor refactoring tool for OCaml. We perform a case
      study on open source Jane Street libraries by using Rotor to refactor
      comparison functions so that they return a more precise variant type
      rather than an integer. We discuss the difficulties of refactoring the
      Jane Street code base, which makes extensive use of ppx macros, and
      ongoing work implementing new refactorings.

    description: "Since their inception, state-machine frameworks have proven their
      worth by finding defects in everything from the underlying AUTOSAR
      components of Volvo cars to digital invoicing systems. These case studies
      were carried out with Erlang’s commercial QuickCheck state-machine
      framework from Quviq, but such frameworks are now also available for
      Haskell, F#, Scala, Elixir, Java, etc. We present a typed state-machine
      framework for OCaml based on the QCheck library and illustrate a number of
      concepts common to all such frameworks: state modeling, commands,
      interpreting commands, preconditions, and agreement checking."
