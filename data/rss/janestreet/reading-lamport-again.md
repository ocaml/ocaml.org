<p>We’ve just kicked off an internal distributed-systems seminar. Our inaugral
paper was Lamport’s classic <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs240/readings/lamport.pdf">“Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a
Distributed System”</a>.
I remembered the paper fondly, but hadn’t looked back it it for more than a
decade.</p>
