<p>At Jane Street, we have some experience using FPGAs for low-latency
systems&ndash;FPGAs are programmable hardware where you get the speed of an
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) but without being
committed to a design that&rsquo;s burned into the chip. It wasn&rsquo;t so long
ago that FPGAs were expensive and rare, but these days, you can rent a
$5,000 card on the Amazon AWS cloud for less than $3 an hour.</p>
