<p>Often when writing a new module, I want to write the interface first and save
the implementation for later. This lets me use the module as a black box,
extending the interface as needed to support the rest of the program. When
everything else is finished, I can fill in the implementation, knowing the full
interface I need to support. Of course sometimes the implementation needs to
push back on the interface – this pattern isn’t an absolute – but it’s certainly
a useful starting point. The trick is getting the program to compile at
intermediate stages when the implementation hasn’t been filled in.</p>
