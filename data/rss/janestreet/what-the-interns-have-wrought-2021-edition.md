<p>It&rsquo;s the end of another dev internship season, and this one marked
something of a transition, since halfway through the season, NY-based
interns were invited back to the recently reinvigorated office.  Which
means that many more of us got the chance to meet and hang out with
the interns in person than we did last year.  And hopefully the
interns were able to get a better sense of Jane Street and how it
operates.</p>
