<p>Last year we held a machine learning seminar in our London office,
which was an opportunity to reproduce some classical deep learning
results with a nice twist: we used OCaml as a programming language
rather than Python. This allowed us to train models defined in a
functional way in OCaml on a GPU using TensorFlow.</p>
