<p>Jane Street is sponsoring this year’s <a href="https://makemit.org">MakeMIT
hackathon</a>, and we wanted to create a prize for
the winners that would do justice to the maker spirit of the
competition. As makers ourselves – it’s not unusual to find a
“software” engineer here who hacks on FPGAs or who has a CNC machine
at home – it felt natural to get our hands dirty.</p>
