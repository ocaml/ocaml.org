<p>Web browsers have supported custom
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI">plug-ins</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension">extensions</a> since
the 1990s, giving users the ability to add their own features and
tools for improving workflow or building closer integration with
applications or databases running on back-end servers.</p>
