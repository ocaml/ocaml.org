<p>With the external release of OCaml 4.07.0 imminent, we in Jane Street&rsquo;s
Tools &amp; Compilers group have been planning what we want to work on for
inclusion in OCaml 4.08. These days OCaml uses (or at least attempts) a
time-based release process with releases scheduled every 6 months. We&rsquo;re
trying to avoid rushing in changes at the last minute &ndash; as we&rsquo;ve been
prone to do in the past &ndash; so this list is restricted to things we could
conceivably finish in the next 4-5 months.</p>
