<p>Now that OCaml 4.08 has been released, let&rsquo;s have a look at what was
accomplished, with a particular focus on how <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/plans-for-ocaml-408/">our plans for
4.08</a> fared. I&rsquo;ll mostly focus on work that we
in the Jane Street Tools &amp; Compilers team were involved with, but we are
just some of the contributors to the OCaml compiler, and I&rsquo;ll have a
quick look at the end of the post at some of the other work that went
into 4.08.</p>
