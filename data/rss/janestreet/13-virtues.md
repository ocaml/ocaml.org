<p>Very early on in his life, while on lengthy voyage from London to Philadelphia,
Ben Franklin created a system of thirteen virtues to live his life by. He spent
the remainder of his days giving special focus to one virtue per week in a 13
week cycle, as well as noting the virtues he failed to live up to at the end of
each day.</p>
