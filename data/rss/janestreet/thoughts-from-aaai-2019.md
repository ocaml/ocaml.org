<p>At Jane Street, for the last several years, we have been increasingly interested
in machine learning and its many use cases. This is why it was exciting when
earlier this year myself and a few of my colleagues had the opportunity to
attend the AAAI 2019 conference. Weâ€™d like to take this space to share with you
some of the interesting projects and themes we saw at the conference.</p>
