<p>One of the problems we wrestle with at Jane Street is how to
understand and manage the costs associated with the positions we hold:
things like margin, financing costs, market risk, regulatory capital
requirements, and so on.  To that end, we&rsquo;ve built systems that
estimate these costs and propose ways to reduce them. Essentially,
this is a numerical optimization problem.</p>
