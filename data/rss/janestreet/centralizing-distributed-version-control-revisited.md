<p>7 years ago, I wrote a <a href="/centralizing-distributed-version-control/" title="Centralizing Distributed Version Control">blog
post</a>
about how we at Jane Street were using our distributed version control system
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">hg</code>, though the story would be the same for <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>) in a partially centralized
way. Essentially, we built a centralized repo and a continuous integration
system whose job was to merge in new changesets. The key responsibility of this
system was to make sure that a change was rejected unless it merged, compiled
and <a href="http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html" title="The Not Rocket Science Rule">tested
cleanly</a>.</p>
