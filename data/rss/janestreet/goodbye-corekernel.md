<p>We recently restructured our standard libraries at Jane Street in a
way that eliminates the difference between <code class="highlighter-rouge">Core_kernel</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Core</code>
and we&rsquo;re happy with the result. The new layout should reach the open
source world before the end of the year.</p>
