<blockquote>
  <p>In the once upon a time days of the First Age of Magic, the prudent sorcerer
regarded his own true name as his most valued possession but also the greatest
threat to his continued good health, for&mdash;the stories go&mdash;once an enemy, even a
weak unskilled enemy, learned the sorcerer&rsquo;s true name, then routine and
widely known spells could destroy or enslave even the most powerful. As times
passed, and we graduated to the Age of Reason and thence to the first and
second industrial revolutions, such notions were discredited. Now it seems
that the Wheel has turned full circle (even if there never really was a First
Age) and we are back to worrying about true names again.</p>
