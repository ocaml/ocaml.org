<p>Earlier this year, we created
a <a href="http://github.com/janestreet/ppx_let">ppx_let</a>, a PPX rewriter that
introduces a syntax for working with monadic and applicative libraries like
Command, Async, Result and Incremental. We’ve now amassed about six months of
experience with it, and we’ve now seen enough to recommend it to a wider
audience.</p>
