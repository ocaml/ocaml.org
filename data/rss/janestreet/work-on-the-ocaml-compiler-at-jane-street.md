<p>As Jane Street grows, the quality of the development tools we use
matters more and more.  We increasingly work on the OCaml compiler
itself: adding useful language features, fine-tuning the type system
and improving the performance of the generated code. Alongside this,
we also work on the surrounding toolchain, developing new tools for
profiling, debugging, documentation and build automation.</p>
