<p>In my last <a href="/self-adjusting-dom/">post</a>, I gave some simple examples showing how
you could use
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">self adjusting computations</a>,
or SAC, as embodied by our <a href="/introducing-incremental/">Incremental</a> library, to
incrementalize the computation of virtual dom nodes. In this post, Iâ€™d like to
discuss how we can extend this approach to more realistic scales, and some of
the extensions to Incremental itself that are required to get there.</p>
