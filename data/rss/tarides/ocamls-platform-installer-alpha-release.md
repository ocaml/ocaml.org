<p>Yesterday we announced the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-10-17-ocaml-5-beta-release">OCaml 5 beta release</a>, and today we're excited to introduce the OCaml Platform Installer! The <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/platform">OCaml Platform</a> is the recommended toolchain when working with OCaml. This new installer enables programmers to quickly set up the OCaml developer environment, so they don't need to waste precious coding time with a lengthy installation process. If you come across any obstacles, the Platform team encourages you to open a <a href="https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-platform-installer/issues">GitHub Issue</a>.</p>
<p>We've also updated the state of the Platform, making several important changes like promoting <code>odoc</code> and OCamlformat from Incubate to Active. We have <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ocaml-platform-installer-alpha-release/10652">notified the OCaml Community</a> about the Platform Installer's alpha release, so you can read about all the new changes and the simple installation process on the <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ocaml-platform-installer-alpha-release/10652">OCaml Discuss post</a>.</p>
