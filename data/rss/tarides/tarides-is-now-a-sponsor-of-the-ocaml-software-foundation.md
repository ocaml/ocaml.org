<p>Tarides is pleased to provide support for the <a href="https://ocaml-sf.org">OCaml Software
Foundation</a>, a non-profit foundation hosted by
the Inria Foundation. The OCaml Software Foundation's mission is to
promote the OCaml programming language and its ecosystem by
supporting the growth of a diverse and international community of
OCaml users.</p>
<p>Tarides develops secure-by-design solutions in which OCaml's memory and
type-safety guarantees play a major role. Hence, most of the software
development that is done at Tarides is in OCaml: for instance,
<a href="https://mirage.io">MirageOS</a>, a library operating system that
constructs unikernels for secure, high-performance network
applications; and <a href="https://irmin.org">Irmin</a>, a library for building
mergeable, branchable distributed data stores, with built-in
snapshotting and support for a wide variety of storage backends.</p>
<p>Tarides is also very involved in the OCaml compiler development and
OCaml developer tooling ecosystem: as active maintainers of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8T_4zqWmq8&amp;list=PLKO_ZowsIOu5fHjRj0ua7_QWE_L789K_f&amp;ab_channel=ocaml2020">OCaml
platform</a>, Tarides is involved with most of the major
OCaml developer tools, including <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml">opam</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/dune">dune</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">merlin</a>.</p>
