<p>We are thrilled to announce that Tarides is laureate of the 21st
edition of the <a href="http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid5745/le-concours-i-lab-2019-un-tremplin-pour-les-entrepreneurs-de-la-deep-tech.html">i-Lab innovation contest</a>
for its innovative technological solution: <strong>OSMOSE</strong>.</p>
<p>Organized by the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and
Innovation in partnership with Bpifrance, the objective of this
competition is to identify and support innovative technology-based
projects. This year, over 700 applications have been registered and 75
projects rewarded. The jury was composed of fifty experts (business
leaders, researchers, former laureate, start-uppers, engineers,
consultants, investors) and was chaired by Ludovic Le Moan, CEO of
Sigfox.</p>
<p>The OSMOSE solution is a software infrastructure platform to deploy
secure and distributed IoT applications, using low-resource
constraints and providing low-latency performance. This platform is
built upon innovative and open-source projects (in particular MirageOS
and Irmin) which were started at the University of Cambridge, over 10
years ago, where the founders of Tarides met. Tarides uses unikernel
technologies and applies the research done in programming languages to
real-world systems to build safe and performant applications
specialized to their runtime environment.</p>
