<p>Tarides takes great pride in a diverse workforce and strives to continue
bringing talented people to its team from around the globe. This is why Sonja
Heinze, a Tarides software engineer, and the Head of HR, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se Lutton, will
attend WomenHack, an online event dedicated to recruiting more women into the
tech world. They're participating not only to present Tarides to the Women In
Tech community, but to also network and possibly find new talented programmers
to join our growing team.</p>
<p>The <strong>WomenHack</strong> event has a unique setup similar to 'speed dating,' but for
prospective jobs. Each candidate is paired with a company, and they have 5
minutes to chat before moving on to the next company. This &quot;rapid interview&quot; is
both fun and efficient for all involved, and it ensures each company will meet
several talented candidates from diverse backgrounds, which increases their
chance of finding that perfect fit for an open position!</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://womenhack.com/">WomenHack</a></strong> is a community that empowers women in
