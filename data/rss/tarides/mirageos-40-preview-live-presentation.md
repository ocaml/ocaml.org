<p>The official release of MirageOS 4.0 quickly approaches! Learn about some general MirageOS concepts and get a
sneak park at the forthcoming changes in MirageOS 4.0 during a LIVE presentation today at 15h CET.</p>
<p>Lucas Pluvinage will lead you through a live-streaming presentation to acquaint you with MirageOS 4.0. You&rsquo;ll learn
what kinds of problems MirageOS can solve and about Functoria, the compilation model. Then Lucas will also discuss the switch
to the&nbsp;Dune&nbsp;build system and how that enables cross-compilation, not to mention the creation of new compilation targets,
such as the Raspberry Pi!</p>
