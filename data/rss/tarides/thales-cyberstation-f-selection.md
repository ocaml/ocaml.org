<p>The  <a href="https://cyber-at-stationf.com//">Cyber@Station F</a> program was established by <a href="https://thalesdigital.io/">Thales Digital Factory</a> at <a href="https://stationf.co">Station F</a> to &ldquo;help accelerate startups&rsquo; development in cybersecurity by providing them advice, expertise, and access to our big markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thales Cyber@Station F is a startup acceleration program that centres around the areas of cybersecurity &amp; trust. It guides its participants through four stages: Select, Define, Deliver &amp; Test, and Business Acceleration. The stages are designed to give each startup an opportunity to come up with and test a proof of concept with potential clients, which if successful is then developed further.</p>

<p>At Tarides we know that a lot of today&rsquo;s technology solutions are overly complex, vulnerable to attack, and time consuming to develop. As an alternative to this, we provide secure, safe, and efficient solutions by leveraging the features of OCaml in combination with cutting-edge tools and technologies. In collaboration with a rich open-source community, we develop and maintain the OCaml language, the operating system MirageOS including Unikernels, as well as a range of developer tools.</p>
<p>The OCaml language is efficient, writes safe and secure code, and is easy to maintain and adapt thanks to its modular nature. When combined with MirageOS and Unikernels, which reduce runtime complexity for lightweight and accurate results, OCaml&rsquo;s already impressive features are used more effectively. Finally, our range of modern, easy-to-use tools offer developers a range of options for writing projects in OCaml.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is at the heart of what we do, and we&rsquo;re excited to combine our knowledge and experience with the substantial resources offered by Thales and Station F. We are also looking forward to engaging with other companies in the same industry and discovering new opportunities for our projects and our clients.</p>

<p>The programme started at the beginning of June, and we&rsquo;ll follow up with more developments as they happen. In the meantime, we&rsquo;ve selected some relevant posts and information on our work in cybersecurity you can read if you want to know more. We&rsquo;ve received funding from the EU for our work on a <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2021-04-30-scop-selected-for-dapsi-initiative">secure open messaging</a> platform, we&rsquo;ve been laureates of the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2019-07-05-i-lab-2019">i-Lab innovation contest</a> for our work on Osmose, and we&rsquo;ve won the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2019-12-11-tarides-wins-the-fic-2020-startup-award">2020 FIC startup award</a>.  If you want to read up on the technical side of things, these papers on <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-kaloper-mersinjak.pdf">unikernels</a> and on  <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/papers/2018-hotpost-osmose.pdf">Osmose</a> are a good place to start.</p>
