<p>The <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu">Data Portability and Services Incubator (DAPSI)</a> is
an EU funded project, under the European Commission&rsquo;s Next Generation Internet
(NGI) initiative. The aim of this initiave is to empower top internet innovators
to develop human-centric solutions. DAPSI addresses the challenge of personal
data portability on the internet, as foreseen under the GDPR and make it
significantly easier for citizens to have any data which is stored with one
service provider transmitted directly to another provider.</p>

portfolio</a> to see more information about the
selected projects.</p>

<p>Our project, called <strong>SCoP</strong> for <strong>Secure-by-design Communication Protocols</strong>,
is taking part in the DAPSI to tackle data portability issues in communication
services.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, the usage of emails has been massively widespread by
both individuals and companies. Billions of emails are sent every day and this
number is expected to increase to reach 333 billion of emails exchanged daily
in 2022. Moreover, as managing internet communication stacks have become
increasingly complex, end-users have tended to entrust this task to third-party
companies like Google and Microsoft. Furthermore, existing implementations of
these communication services rely on ad-hoc methodologies and memory-unsafe
languages, where minor developer errors can easily escalate into major security
flaws. The centralization of these communication services means that a single
successful attack leads to major personal data breaches.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, <strong>our project aims to engineer a modern basis for open
messaging that supports existing protocols such as emails but is also extensible
and customizable for emerging protocols such as matrix</strong>. We will be building
trustable implementations of these open protocols using type-safe languages and
we will deploy these implementations as specialized, secure and resource
efficient unikernels. They will become the basis of the communication system of
OSMOSE, Tarides&rsquo; commercial solution for secure-by-design IoT infrastructure.</p>
<p>Every component of that system will be carefully designed as independent
libraries, using modern development techniques to avoid the common reported
threats and flaws. For instance, the implementation of protocol parsers and
serializers will be written in a type-safe language and will be using fuzzing,
e.g state-of-the-art coverage-driven tests. The combination of these techniques
will increase users&rsquo; trust to migrate their personal data to these new secure
services.</p>
<p>Moreover, these techniques are also useful to produce a large and reusable
corpus of test materials, which we plan to release separately for other
implementations to use. It will give the tools to other developers to write the
next generation of messaging applications by extending the existing protocols
with more confidence.</p>
