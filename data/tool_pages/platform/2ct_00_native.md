OCaml can compile to native code, delivering high-performance executables with optimized machine code for production environments.

## What is OCaml Native Code?

OCaml native code is generated by **ocamlopt**, the native-code compiler that produces standalone executables with integrated runtime and garbage collector. Key characteristics:

- Faster runtime performance than bytecode
- Stand-alone executables requiring no external runtime
- Cross-module inlining and optimization
- Production-ready deployments

## When to Use Native Code

**Use native code** (ocamlopt) when you need faster runtime performance in production, want standalone executables, or are deploying to end users.

**Use bytecode** (ocamlc) for fast iteration during development, CI/testing environments where compilation speed matters, or maximum portability.

The typical OCaml workflow: develop with bytecode for fast compile times, switch to native code for production releases. The same source code compiles to both targets without modification.

## Platform Support

The native-code compiler is available only on 64-bit systems (OCaml 5.0+):

- **x86-64 (AMD64)** - Linux, macOS, Windows
- **ARM64 (AArch64)** - Linux, macOS (including Apple Silicon)
- **RISC-V** - Linux
- **IBM Z (s390x)** - Linux (OCaml 5.1+)

**Windows:** Native compilation is supported via MSVC, MinGW, or Cygwin toolchains. See [OCaml on Windows](https://ocaml.org/docs/ocaml-on-windows) for setup details.

If your target platform lacks native code support, the bytecode compiler provides a highly portable fallback.
