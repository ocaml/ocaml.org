  - title: A memory model for multicore OCaml
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      We propose a memory model for OCaml, broadly following the design of axiomatic
      memory models for languages such as C++ and Java, but with a number of
      differences to provide stronger guarantees and easier reasoning to the programmer,
      at the expense of not admitting every possible optimisation.

  - title: Extending OCaml's 'open'
    publication: Open Publishing Association
    abstract: >
      We propose a harmonious extension of OCaml's 'open' construct.
      OCaml's existing construct 'open M' imports the names exported by the module 'M' into the current scope.
      At present 'M' is required to be the path to a module. We propose extending 'open' to instead accept an arbitrary module expression,
      making it possible to succinctly address a number of existing scope-related difficulties that arise when writing OCaml programs.

  - title: Eff Directly in OCaml
    publication: Open Publishing Association
    abstract: >
      The language Eff is an OCaml-like language serving as a prototype implementation
      of the theory of algebraic effects, intended for experimentation with algebraic
      effects on a large scale.
      We present the embedding of Eff into OCaml, using the library of delimited
      continuations or the multicore OCaml branch. We demonstrate the correctness of
      the embedding denotationally, relying on the tagless-final-style interpreter-based
      denotational semantics, including the novel, direct denotational semantics of
      multi-prompt delimited control. The embedding is systematic, lightweight, performant
      and supports even higher-order, 'dynamic' effects with their polymorphism.
      OCaml thus may be regarded as another implementation of Eff, broadening the
      scope and appeal of that language.

    publication: Benjamin C. Pierce, editor, Advanced Topics in Types and
      Programming Languages, MIT Press
    abstract: >
      This book chapter gives an in-depth abstract of the Core ML type system,
      with an emphasis on type inference.  The type inference algorithm is
      described as the composition of a constraint generator, which produces a
      system  of type equations, and a constraint solver, which is presented as
      a set of rewrite rules.

  - title: Relaxing the value restriction
    publication: International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming

      This paper explains why it is sound to generalize certain type variables
      at a `let` binding, even when the expression that is being `let`-bound is
      not a value. This relaxed version of Wright's classic “value restriction”
      was introduced in OCaml 3.07.

  - title: Manifest Types, Modules, and Separate Compilation
    publication: Principles of Programming Languages
    abstract: >
      This paper presents a variant of the Standard ML module system that
      introduces a strict distinction between abstract  and manifest types. The
      latter are types whose definitions explicitly appear as part of a module
      interface. This proposal  is meant to retain most of the expressive power
      of the Standard ML module system, while providing much better support
      for  separate compilation. This work sets the formal bases for OCaml's
      module system.

      This work extends the above paper by introducing so-called applicative
      functors, that is, functors that produce compatible  abstract types when
      applied to provably equal arguments. Applicative functors are also a
      feature of OCaml.

      This accessible paper describes a simplified implementation of the OCaml
      module system, emphasizing the fact that the module system  is largely
      independent of the underlying core language. This is a good tutorial to
      learn both how modules can be used and how  they are typechecked.

    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      In this talk we present our work on a syntax definition for the OCaml
      language in the syntax definition formalism SDF3.  SDF3 supports
      high-level definition of concrete and abstract syntax through declarative
      disambiguation and definition of  constructors, enabling a direct mapping
      to abstract syntax. Based on the SDF3 syntax definition, the Spoofax
      language  workbench produces a complete syntax aware editor with a parser,
      syntax checking, parse error recovery, syntax highlighting,  formatting
      with correct parenthesis insertion, and syntactic completion. The syntax
      definition should provide a good  basis for experiments with the design of
      OCaml and the development of further tooling. In the talk we will
      highlight  interesting aspects the syntax definition, discuss issues we
      encountered in the syntax of OCaml, and demonstrate the editor.

  - title: A Simple State-Machine Framework for Property-Based Testing in OCaml
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      Since their inception state-machine frameworks have proven their worth by
      finding defects in everything  from the underlying AUTOSAR components of
      Volvo cars to digital invoicing sys- tems. These case studies were
      carried  out with Erlang’s commercial QuickCheck state-machine framework
      from Quviq, but such frameworks are now also available  for Haskell, F#,
      Scala, Elixir, Java, etc. We present a typed state-machine framework for
      OCaml based on the QCheck  library and illustrate a number concepts common
      to all such frameworks: state modeling, commands, interpreting commands,
      preconditions, and agreement checking.

  - title: "AD-OCaml: Algorithmic Differentiation for OCaml"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      AD-OCaml is a library framework for calculating mathematically exact
      derivatives and  deep power series approximations of almost arbitrary
      OCaml programs via algorithmic  differentiation. Unlike similar
      frameworks, this includes programs with side effects,  aliasing, and
      programs with nested derivative operators. The framework also offers
      implicit  parallelization of both user programs and their transformations.
      The presentation will provide  a short introduction to the mathematical
      problem, the difficulties of implementing a solution,  the design of the
      library, and a demonstration of its capabilities.

  - title: "API migration: compare transformed"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      In this talk we describe our experience in using an automatic
      API-migration strategy dedicated at changing  the signatures of OCaml
      functions, using the Rotor refactoring tool for OCaml. We perform a case
      study on  open source Jane Street libraries by using Rotor to refactor
      comparison functions so that they return a  more precise variant type
      rather than an integer. We discuss the difficulties of refactoring the
      Jane Street  code base, which makes extensive use of ppx macros, and
      ongoing work implementing new refactorings.

  - title: Irmin v2
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      Irmin is an OCaml library for building distributed databases with the same
      design principles as Git.  Existing Git users will find many familiar
      features: branching/merging, immutable causal history for  all changes,
      and the ability to restore to any previous state. Irmin v2 adds new
      accessibility methods  to the store: we can now use Irmin from a CLI, or
      in a browser using irmin-graphql. It also has a new  backend, irmin-pack,
      which is optimised for space usage and is used by the Tezos blockchain.

  - title: LexiFi Runtime Types
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      LexiFi maintains an OCaml compiler extension that enables introspection
      through runtime type representations.  Recently, we implemented a syntax
      extension (PPX) that enables the use of LexiFi runtime types on vanilla
      compilers.  We propose to present our publicly available runtime types and
      their features. Most notably, we want to present  a mechanism for pattern
      matching on runtime types with holes.

  - title: "OCaml Under the Hood: SmartPy"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      SmartPy is a complete system to develop smart-contracts for the Tezos
      blockchain. It is an embedded EDSL in python  to write contracts and their
      tests scenarios. It includes an online IDE, a chain explorer, and a
      command line interface.  Python is used to generate programs in an
      imperative, type inferred, intermediate language called SmartML. SmartML
      is  also the name of the OCaml library which provides an interpreter, a
      compiler to Michelson (the smart-contract language of Tezos),  as well as
      a scenario “on-chain” interpreter. The IDE uses a mix of OCaml built with
      js_of_ocaml and pure Javascript.  The command line interface also builds
      with js_of_ocaml to run on Node.js.

    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      OCaml-CI is a CI service for OCaml projects. It uses metadata from the
      project’s opam and dune files to work out what to build,  and uses caching
      to make builds fast. It automatically tests projects against multiple
      OCaml versions and OS platforms. The CI has been deployed on around 50
      projects so far on GitHub, and many of them see response times an order of
      magnitude quicker than  with less integrated CI solutions. This talk will
      introduce the CI service and then look at some of the technologies used to
      build it.

  - title: Parallelising your OCaml Code with Multicore OCaml
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      With the availability of multicore variants of the recent OCaml versions
      (4.10 and 4.11) that maintain  backwards compatibility with the existing
      OCaml C-API, there has been increasing interest in the wider  OCaml
      community for parallelising existing OCaml code.

  - title: The ImpFS Filesystem
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      This proposal describes a presentation to be given at the OCaml’20
      workshop. The presentation will cover a new OCaml filesystem,  ImpFS, and
      the related libraries. The filesystem makes use of a B-tree library
      presented at OCaml’17, and a key-value store  presented at ML’19. In
      addition, there are a number of other support libraries that may be of
      interest to the community. ImpFS  represents a single point in the
      filesystem design space, but we hope that the libraries we have developed
      will enable others to  build further filesystems with novel features.

  - title: The final pieces of the OCaml documentation puzzle
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      Odoc is the latest attempt at creating a documentation tool which handles
      the full complexity of the OCaml language. It has been a long  time coming
      as tackling both the module system and rendering into rich documents makes
      for a difficult task. Nevertheless we believe  the two recent developments
      provides the final pieces of the OCaml documentation puzzle. This two
      improvements split odoc in two  layers: a model layer, with a deep
      understanding of the module system, and a document layer allowing for easy
      definition of new outputs.

  - title: Types in Amber
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      Coda is a new cryptocurrency that uses zk-SNARKs to dramatically reduce
      the size of data needed by nodes running its protocol. Nodes
      communicate  in a format automatically derived from type definitions in
      OCaml source files. As the Coda software evolves, these formats for sent
      data may change. We wish to allow nodes running older versions of the
      software to communicate with newer versions. To achieve that, we identify
      stable types that  must not change over time, so that their serializations
      also do not change.
