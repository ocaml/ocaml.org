  - title: "Retrofitting Parallelism onto OCaml"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      OCaml is an industrial-strength, multi-paradigm programming language,
      widely used in industry and academia. OCaml is also one of the
      few modern managed system programming languages to lack support
      for shared memory parallel programming. This paper describes the design,
      a full-fledged implementation and evaluation of a mostly-concurrent
      garbage collector (GC) for the multicore extension of the
      OCaml programming language. Given that we propose to add parallelism
      to a widely used programming language with millions of lines of
      existing code, we face the challenge of maintaining backwards
      compatibility -- not just in terms of the language features but also the
      performance of single-threaded code running with the new GC.
      To this end, the paper presents a series of novel techniques and
      demonstrates that the new GC strikes a balance between performance
      and feature backwards compatibility for sequential programs
      and scales admirably on modern multicore processors.

  - title: "Bounding Data Races in Space and Time"
    publication: Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI)
    abstract: >
      We propose a new semantics for shared-memory parallel
      programs that gives strong guarantees even in the presence
      of data races. Our local data race freedom property guar-
      antees that all data-race-free portions of programs exhibit
      sequential semantics. We provide a straightforward oper-
      ational semantics and an equivalent axiomatic model, and
      evaluate an implementation for the OCaml programming
      language. Our evaluation demonstrates that it is possible to
      balance a comprehensible memory model with a reasonable
      (no overhead on x86, ~0.6% on ARM) sequential performance
      trade-off in a mainstream programming language

  - title: "Retrofitting Effect Handlers Onto OCaml"
    publication: Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI)
    abstract: >
      Effect handlers have been gathering momentum as a mechanism for modular
      programming with user-defined effects. Effect handlers allow for non-local
      control flow mechanisms such as generators, async/await, lightweight threads,
      and coroutines to be composably expressed. We present a design and evaluate
      a full-fledged efficient implementation of effect handlers for OCaml, an
      industrial-strength multi-paradigm programming language. Our implementation
      strives to maintain the backwards compatibility and performance profile of
      existing OCaml code. Retrofitting effect handlers onto OCaml is challenging
      since OCaml does not currently have any non-local control flow mechanisms
      other than exceptions. Our implementation of effect handlers for OCaml:
      (i) imposes a mean 1% overhead on a comprehensive macro benchmark suite
      that does not use effect handlers;
      (ii) remains compatible with program analysis tools that inspect the
      stack;
      and (iii) is efficient for new code that makes use of effect handlers.

  - title: "Cosmo : A Concurrent Separation Logic for Multicore OCaml"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      Multicore OCaml extends OCaml with support for shared-memory concurrency.
      It is equipped with a weak memory model, for which an operational
      semantics has been published. This begs the question: what reasoning rules
      can one rely upon while writing or verifying Multicore OCaml code?
      To answer it, we instantiate Iris, a modern descendant of Concurrent
      Separation Logic, for Multicore OCaml. This yields a low-level program
      logic whose reasoning rules expose the details of the memory model.
      On top of it, we build a higher-level logic, Cosmo, which trades off some
      expressive power in return for a simple set of reasoning rules that allow
      accessing nonatomic locations in a data-race-free manner, exploiting the
      sequentially-consistent behavior of atomic locations, and exploiting the
      release/acquire behavior of atomic locations.
      Cosmo allows both low-level reasoning, where the details of the Multicore
      OCaml memory model are apparent, and high-level reasoning, which is
      independent of this memory model. We illustrate this claim via a number of
      case studies: we verify several implementations of locks with respect to a
      classic, memory-model-independent specification. Thus, a coarse-grained
      application that uses locks as the sole means of synchronisation can be
      verified in the Concurrent-Separation-Logic fragment of Cosmo, without
      any knowledge of the weak memory model.

  - title: "Formal Verification of a Concurrent Bounded Queue in a Weak Memory Model"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      We use Cosmo, a modern concurrent separation logic, to formally specify
      and verify an implementation of a multiple-producer multiple-consumer
      concurrent queue in the setting of the Multicore OCaml weak memory model.
      We view this result as a demonstration and experimental verification of
      the manner in which Cosmo allows modular and formal reasoning about
      advanced concurrent data structures. In particular, we show how the joint
      use of logically atomic triples and of Cosmo's views makes it possible to
      describe precisely in the specification the interaction between the queue
      library and the weak memory model.

  - title: "A Separation Logic for Effect Handlers"
    publication: Principles of Programming Languages (POPL)
    abstract: >
      User-defined effects and effect handlers are advertised and advocated as a
      relatively easy-to-understand and modular approach to delimited control.
      They offer the ability of suspending and resuming a computation and allow
      information to be transmitted both ways between the computation, which
      requests a certain service, and the handler, which provides this service.
      Yet, a key question remains, to this day, largely unanswered: how does
      one modularly specify and verify programs in the presence of both
      user-defined effect handlers and primitive effects, such as heap-allocated
      mutable state? We answer this question by presenting a Separation Logic
      with built-in support for effect handlers, both shallow and deep. The
      specification of a program fragment includes a protocol that describes the
      effects that the program may perform as well as the replies that it can
      expect to receive. The logic allows local reasoning via a frame rule and a
      bind rule. It is based on Iris and inherits all of its advanced features,
      including support for higher-order functions, user-defined ghost state,
      and invariants. We illustrate its power via several case studies,
      including (1) a generic formulation of control inversion, which turns a
      producer that ``pushes'' elements towards a consumer into a producer from
      which one can ``pull'' elements on demand, and (2) a simple system for
      cooperative concurrency, where several threads execute concurrently, can
      spawn new threads, and communicate via promises.

  - title: "A Memory Model for Multicore OCaml"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      We propose a memory model for OCaml, broadly following the design of axiomatic
      memory models for languages such as C++ and Java, but with a number of
      differences to provide stronger guarantees and easier reasoning to the programmer,
      at the expense of not admitting every possible optimisation.

  - title: "Extending OCaml's `open`"
    publication: Open Publishing Association
    abstract: >
      We propose a harmonious extension of OCaml's `open` construct.
      OCaml's existing construct `open M` imports the names exported by the module `M` into the current scope.
      At present `M` is required to be the path to a module. We propose extending `open` to instead accept an arbitrary module expression,
      making it possible to succinctly address a number of existing scope-related difficulties that arise when writing OCaml programs.

  - title: "Eff Directly in OCaml"
    publication: Open Publishing Association
    abstract: >
      The language Eff is an OCaml-like language serving as a prototype implementation
      of the theory of algebraic effects, intended for experimentation with algebraic
      effects on a large scale.
      We present the embedding of Eff into OCaml, using the library of delimited
      continuations or the Multicore OCaml branch. We demonstrate the correctness of
      the embedding denotationally, relying on the tagless-final-style interpreter-based
      denotational semantics, including the novel, direct denotational semantics of
      multi-prompt delimited control. The embedding is systematic, lightweight, performant,
      and supports even higher-order, 'dynamic' effects with their polymorphism.
      OCaml thus may be regarded as another implementation of Eff, broadening the
      scope and appeal of that language.

      a set of rewrite rules.

      This paper presents a variant of the Standard ML module system that
      introduces a strict distinction between abstract and manifest types. The
      latter are types whose definitions explicitly appear as part of a module
      interface. This proposal is meant to retain most of the expressive power
      of the Standard ML module system, while providing much better support
      for separate compilation. This work sets the formal bases for OCaml's
      module system.

    publication: Technical report 117, INRIA
    abstract: >
      This report contains a abstract of the ZINC compiler, which later evolved
      into Caml Light, then into OCaml. Large parts of this report are out of
      date, but it is still valuable as a abstract of the abstract machine used
      in Caml Light and (with some further simplifications and speed
      improvements) in OCaml.

    publication: Proceedings of the sixth ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      We present improvements to the backtracking technique of pattern-matching
      compilation. Several optimizations are introduced, such as commutation of
      patterns, use of exhaustiveness information, and control flow optimization
      through the use of labeled static exceptions and context information.
      These optimizations have been integrated in the Objective-Caml compiler.
      They have shown good results in increasing the speed of pattern-matching
      intensive programs, without increasing final code size.

    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      In this talk we present our work on a syntax definition for the OCaml
      language in the syntax definition formalism SDF3. SDF3 supports
      high-level definition of concrete and abstract syntax through declarative
      disambiguation and definition of constructors, enabling a direct mapping
      to abstract syntax. Based on the SDF3 syntax definition, the Spoofax
      language workbench produces a complete syntax aware editor with a parser,
      syntax checking, parse error recovery, syntax highlighting, formatting
      with correct parenthesis insertion, and syntactic completion. The syntax
      definition should provide a good basis for experiments with the design of
      OCaml and the development of further tooling. In the talk we will
      highlight interesting aspects the syntax definition, discuss issues we
      encountered in the syntax of OCaml, and demonstrate the editor.

      Since their inception state-machine frameworks have proven their worth by
      finding defects in everything from the underlying AUTOSAR components of
      Volvo cars to digital invoicing sys- tems. These case studies were
      carried out with Erlang’s commercial QuickCheck state-machine framework
      from Quviq, but such frameworks are now also available for Haskell, F#,
      Scala, Elixir, Java, etc. We present a typed state-machine framework for
      OCaml based on the QCheck library and illustrate a number concepts common
      to all such frameworks: state modeling, commands, interpreting commands,
      preconditions, and agreement checking.

      AD-OCaml is a library framework for calculating mathematically exact
      derivatives and deep power series approximations of almost arbitrary
      OCaml programs via algorithmic differentiation. Unlike similar
      frameworks, this includes programs with side effects, aliasing, and
      programs with nested derivative operators. The framework also offers
      implicit parallelisation of both user programs and their transformations.
      The presentation will provide a short introduction to the mathematical
      problem, the difficulties of implementing a solution, the design of the
      library, and a demonstration of its capabilities.

      study on open source Jane Street libraries by using Rotor to refactor
      comparison functions so that they return a more precise variant type
      rather than an integer. We discuss the difficulties of refactoring the
      Jane Street code base, which makes extensive use of PPX macros, and
      ongoing work implementing new refactorings.

      SmartPy is a complete system to develop smart-contracts for the Tezos
      blockchain. It is an embedded EDSL in Python to write contracts and their
      tests scenarios. It includes an online IDE, a chain explorer, and a
      command line interface. Python is used to generate programs in an
      imperative, type inferred, intermediate language called SmartML. SmartML
      is also the name of the OCaml library which provides an interpreter, a
      compiler to Michelson (the smart-contract language of Tezos), as well as
      a scenario “on-chain” interpreter. The IDE uses a mix of OCaml built with
      `js_of_ocaml` and pure Javascript. The command line interface also builds
      with `js_of_ocaml` to run on Node.js.

      the related libraries. The filesystem makes use of a B-tree library
      presented at OCaml’17 and a key-value store presented at ML’19. In
      addition, there are a number of other support libraries that may be of
      interest to the community. ImpFS represents a single point in the
      filesystem design space, but we hope that the libraries we have developed
      will enable others to build further filesystems with novel features.

      `odoc` is the latest attempt at creating a documentation tool which handles
      the full complexity of the OCaml language. It has been a long time coming
      as tackling both the module system and rendering into rich documents makes
      for a difficult task. Nevertheless we believe the two recent developments
      provides the final pieces of the OCaml documentation puzzle. This two
      improvements split `odoc` in two layers: a model layer, with a deep
      understanding of the module system, and a document layer allowing for easy
      definition of new outputs.

    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      I spend a lot of time hacking the OCaml compiler. Hence when I write some
      code, I have a good glimpse of what the generated assembly will look like.
      This is nice when I want to write performance sensitive code, but as I
      usually write code for which execution time doesn't matter much, this
      mainly tends to torture me. A small voice in my head is telling me "you
      shouldn't write it like that, you known you could avoid this allocation."
      And usually, following that indication would only tend to make the code
      less readable. But there is a solution to calm that voice\: making the
      compiler smarter than me. OCaml compilation mechanisms are quite
      predictable. There is no dark magic to replace your ugly code by a
      well-behaving one, but it always generates reasonably efficient code. This
      is a good thing in general, as you won't be surprised by code running more
      slowly than what you usually expect. But it does not behave very well with
      dumb code. This may not often seem like a problem with code written by
      humans, but generated code, for example coming from camlp4/ppx, or compiled
      from another language to OCaml, may fall into that category. In fact, there
      is another common source for non-human written code: inlining.

      OCamlot provides a distributed, continuous testing service for opam
      package quality and compatibility. Using signals from GitHub, OCamlot
      ensures that, before being merged, patches submitted to the opam
      repository are thoroughly tested on the variety of supported
      configurations, architectures, and systems. The resulting improved build
      and metadata quality in turn speeds up development on other aspects of
      the Platform through earlier error feedback. A high-quality package
      repository is also very important for new user retention.

    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      The OCaml Platform combines the OCaml compiler toolchain with a coherent
      set of tools for build, documentation, testing, and IDE integration. The
      project is a collaborative effort across the OCaml community, tied
      together by the OCaml Labs group in Cambridge and with other major
      contributors listed above. The requirements of the Platform are being
      guided by the industrial OCaml Consortium (primarily Jane Street, Citrix,
      and Lexifi). This talk follows up the OCaml 2013 talk that introduced the
      Platform. Since then, many tools have been released in parallel via the
      opam package manager, and this year’s talk will demonstrate the concrete
      workflow that ties them together (see Figure 2). We will first recap the
      Platform ethos briefly, update on the opam package manager v1.2 and
      conclude with the Platform workflow.

      We present a work-in-progress about adding namespaces to OCaml. Inspired

      formalise a simple and non-intrusive namespace mechanism without
      complexifying the core language. Namespaces in our approach are a simple
      way to define libraries while avoiding name clashes. They are also meant
      to simplify the build process, clarifying and reducing (to zero whenever
      possible) the responsibility of external tools.

      and will have arrived just a year after its predecessor. This talk
      presents features added to opam 2.1 intended to make dealing with multiple
      versions of opam easier. We see how small additional metadata, both stored
      in `.opam` “roots” and also added to opam’s command line to provide opam’s
      developers with the chance to add new features more easily, with
      confidence that users will be able to upgrade safely. In presenting this,
      we’ll also trumpet some of what we think are the amazing new features of
      opam 2.1 (and 2.2) and why we think you should keenly watch for new
      releases and upgrade immediately on release!

      In this talk, we will present an overview of the abstract domains that
      drive the Flambda 2 optimiser for OCaml programs. Like most optimising
      compilers, Flambda 2 relies on static analysis to find optimisation
      opportunities. There are several different analyses that are actually
      performed. Here we will focus on a forward value analysis that we call
      Flambda 2 Types. Despite its name, it fits quite well the definition of
      an abstract domain (in the sense of abstract interpretation), and it is
      through that angle that we will introduce it.

    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      In this presentation, we will explore the compilation of
      garbage-collected languages, such as Java or OCaml, to
      WebAssembly (Wasm). The limitations of JavaScript as the web’s default
      language led to the development of Wasm, a secure and
      predictable-performance modular language. However, compiling
      garbage-collected languages to Wasm presents challenges, including the
      need to compile or re-implement the runtime and difficulties in
      transferring verified properties. Various techniques for representing
      values in memory are discussed, with a focus on OCaml’s approach. An
      extension called Wasm-GC is introduced, enabling the compilation of
      garbage-collected languages to Wasm by incorporating features like `int31`
      and garbage-collected structs. The paper presents Wasocaml, a complete
      OCaml compiler for Wasm-GC, and discusses benchmarks and future work in
      compiling garbage-collected languages to WebAssembly.

  - title: "Unboxed Data Constructors: Or, How cpp Decides a Halting Problem"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      We propose a new language feature for ML-family languages, the ability to
      selectively unbox certain data constructors, so that their runtime
      representation gets compiled away to just the identity on their argument.
      Unboxing must be statically rejected when it could introduce confusion,
      that is, distinct values with the same representation. We discuss the
      use-case of big numbers, where unboxing allows to write code that is both
      efficient and safe, replacing either a safe but slow version or a fast
      but unsafe version. We explain the static analysis necessary to reject
      incorrect unboxing requests. We present our prototype implementation of
      this feature for the OCaml programming language, discuss several design
      choices and the interaction with advanced features such as Guarded
      Algebraic Datatypes. Our static analysis requires expanding type
      definitions in type expressions, which is not necessarily normalizing in
      presence of recursive type definitions. In other words, we must decide
      normalization of terms in the first-order λ-calculus with recursion. We
      provide an algorithm to detect non-termination on-the-fly during
      reduction, with proofs of correctness and completeness. Our algorithm
      turns out to be closely related to the normalization strategy for macro
      expansion in the cpp preprocessor.

    publication: Principles of Programming Languages (POPL)
    abstract: >
      In call-by-value languages, some mutually-recursive definitions can be
      safely evaluated to build recursive functions or cyclic data structures,
      but some definitions (let rec x = x + 1) contain vicious circles and
      their evaluation fails at runtime. We propose a new static analysis to
      check the absence of such runtime failures. We present a set of
      declarative inference rules, prove its soundness with respect to the
      reference source-level semantics of Nordlander, Carlsson, and Gill
      [2008], and show that it can be directed into an algorithmic backwards
      analysis check in a surprisingly simple way. Our implementation of this
      new check replaced the existing check used by the OCaml programming
      language, a fragile syntactic criterion which let several subtle bugs
      slip through as the language kept evolving. We document some issues that
      arise when advanced features of a real-world functional language
      (exceptions in first-class modules, GADTs, etc.) interact with safety
      checking for recursive definitions.

  - title: "Merlin: A Language Server for OCaml (Experience Report)"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      We report on the experience of developing Merlin, a language server for
      the OCaml programming language in development since 2013. Merlin is a
      daemon that connects to your favourite text editor and provides services
      that require a fine-grained understanding of the programming language
      syntax and static semantics: instant feedback on warnings and errors,
      autocompletion, 'type of the code under the cursor', 'go to definition',
      etc. Language servers need to handle incomplete and partially-incorrect
      programs, and try to be incremental to minimize recomputation after small
      editing actions. Merlin was built by carefully adapting the existing tools
      (the OCamllex lexer and Menhir parser generators) to better support
      incrementality, incompleteness and error handling. These extensions are
      elegant and general, as demonstrated by the interesting, unplanned uses
      that the OCaml community found for them. They could be adapted to other
      frontends -- in any language. Besides incrementality, we discuss the way
      Merlin communicates with editors, describe the design decisions that went
      into some demanding features and report on some of the non-apparent
      difficulties in building good editor support, emerging from expressive
      programming languages or frustrating tooling ecosystems. We expect this
      experience report to be of interest to authors of interactive language
      tooling for any programming language; many design choices may be reused,
      and some hard-won lessons can serve as warnings.

  - title: "Tail Modulo Cons, OCaml, and Relational Separation Logic"
    publication: Principles of Programming Languages (POPL)
    abstract: >
      Common functional languages incentivize tail-recursive functions, as
      opposed to general recursive functions that consume stack space and may
      not scale to large inputs. This distinction occasionally requires writing
      functions in a tail-recursive style that may be more complex and slower
      than the natural, non-tail-recursive definition. This work describes our
      implementation of the tail modulo constructor (TMC) transformation in the
      OCaml compiler, an optimization that provides stack-efficiency for a
      larger class of functions—tail-recursive modulo constructors—which
      includes in particular the natural definition of `List.map` and many
      similar recursive data-constructing functions. We prove the correctness
      of this program transformation in a simplified setting—a small untyped
      calculus—that captures the salient aspects of the OCaml implementation.
      Our proof is mechanized in the Coq proof assistant, using the Iris base
      logic. An independent contribution of our work is an extension of the
      Simuliris approach to define simulation relations that support different
      calling conventions. To our knowledge, this is the first use of Simuliris
      to prove the correctness of a compiler transformation.

      WxWidgets is a well-known cross-platform library to build graphical user interfaces
      for desktop applications. It has bindings for many languages, among which the most

      error-prone — work, because, to be useful, hundreds of C++ classes with tens of methods
      have to be accessible though the binding.
      In this paper, we show how this problem was solved in the case of wxOCaml, providing
      an easy to use, easy to extend binding supporting multiple versions of WxWidgets.

  - title: "A Case for Multi-Switch Constraints in OPAM"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      Package managers usually only deal with packages and their versions, and the constraints
      on their dependencies towards other packages’ versions. Among package managers, opam
      is probably the first one to introduce the notion of switch, i.e. the ability to
      manage different directories, where different sets of packages with different versions are
      installed, as each directory is treated as an independant universe when solving dependency
      constraints. In this talk, we will support a case to be able, in opam, to manage
      different switches in the same universe, allowing to express dependency constraints that
      cross switch boundaries.

  - title: "Using Preferences to Tame your Package Manager"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      Determining whether some components can be installed on a system is a complex problem:
      not only it is NP-complete in the worst case, but there can also be exponentially many
      solutions to it. Ordinary package managers use ad-hoc heuristics to solve this installation
      problem and choose a particular solution, making extremely difficult to change or sidestep
      these heuristics when the result is not the one we expect.
      When software repositories become complex enough, one gets vastly superior results by
      delegating dependency handling to a specialised solver, and use optimisation functions (or
      preferences) to control the class of solutions that are found.
      The opam package manager relies on the CUDF pivot format, which allows OCaml users
      that have a CUDF-compliant solver on their machine to reap the benefits of preferences-
      based dependency resolution. Thanks to the solver farm provided by Irill, these benefits are
      now extended to the OCaml community at large.
      In this talk we will present the preferences language and explain how to use it.

    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      We present operf, a set of tools to benchmark the OCaml compiler, with both micro-
      benchmarks, for fast feedback during development, and macro-benchmarks, for results on a
      larger set of benchmarks.

    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      In this talk, we will present the opam-builder system. opam-builder is an online service
      that monitors the official OPAM repository, continuously builds all versions of all packages
      for 6 different versions of OCaml, and display html reports with all the information about
      failed installations. It can be used both by repository maintainers and package developers
      as a useful tool to improve the quality of the OPAM repository

  - title: "ocp-lint, A Plugin-based Style-Checker with Semantic Patches"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      In this talk, we will present ocp-lint, a new
      style-checker for OCaml projects. ocp-lint can
      typically be used to check pull-requests in a
      Github-style workflow. ocp-lint is highly extensible,
      with a simple API to define new plugins that can be linked dynamically.
      ocp-lint is easily configurable, with plugin- and
      analysis-specific options and arguments. ocp-lint can also use semantic patches,
      a patch-style format to describe code patterns to detect. Warnings
      found by ocp-lint are stored in a database, to avoid useless recomputations
      and ease the development of external tools and GUIs to exploit its results

  - title: "Tezos: the OCaml Crypto-Ledger"
    publication: International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
    abstract: >
      In this talk, we will present the story of the Tezos project. Tezos is a crypto-ledger,
      i.e. a distributed blockchain with a language to express smart contracts, with two specific
      characteristics: the first one is its ability for self-amendment, that allows a majority of
      stake-holders to update the behavior of Tezos without risking a fork; the second one is a
      design and implementation (in OCaml) that took into account safety and security from
      the very beginning, and in particular the use of static typing and formal methods when
      possible. For example, Michelson, the smart contract language of Tezos, is the only such
      language with a formal semantics, a type system ensuring no runtime errors, and an
      implementation that uses OCaml GADTs to ensure its correctness
