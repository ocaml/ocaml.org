        description: >
          The aim of this project is to extend an existing testcase-generator for the OCaml compiler,
          using a reference interpreter (existing or newly developed) to find a lot of bugs in the compiler,
          and fix as much of them as possible.

      - title: "Structured output format for the OCaml compiler messages"
        description: >
          Usually, the output messages from the compiler are a bit more difficult to read for a machine
          and hence it's more time consuming to find the warnings, errors, etc. and their origin. By producing
          a structured output for compiler messages, other tools can more easily interoperate with them and
          provide tooling on top of the messages.

        description: >
          opam is the source-based package manager for OCaml code. This project comprises of writing a new web
          client for rendering output from the opam package database. There is a JSON endpoint on opam.ocaml.org
          which provides information about packages which would provide metadata about the packages.  We can extend
          this JSON metadata to include all the opam packages (not just the top 10) and use that to power a search
          frontend for the website. This may include presenting the data as a GraphQL endpoint with the frontend
          querying that endpoint using GraphQL.

        description: >
          TopoJSON is an extension to GeoJSON to encode topology. This allows for redundant data
          to be removed and file sizes to be greatly reduced. This is often very desirable especially
          when working with data in the browser. This project looks to extend ocaml-geojson to support TopoJSON.

          Outreachy internship a new OCaml library was implemented to provide an OCaml library for TopoJSON, this project will
          build on this adding more functionality to the library and providing a non-blocking, streaming codec version similar
          to the geojsone library.
