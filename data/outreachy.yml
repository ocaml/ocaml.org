        description: >
          MirageOS (see http://xenproject.org/developers/teams/mirage-os.html,
          http://www.openmirage.org/) is a type-safe unikernel written in OCaml.
          It generates highly specialised "appliance" VMs that run directly
          on Xen without requiring an intervening kernel. A MirageOS
          application typically runs via several communicating kernel instances
          on the cloud. Today these instances are difficult to manage; we would
          like to explore strategies for managing these distributed
          computations using common public cloud APIs, such as those exposed by
          Amazon EC2 and Rackspace.

          First we need to create pure OCaml API bindings for (e.g.) EC2 and
          Rackspace (purity is needed to ensure portability). These API
          bindings can then be used to provide operating-system-level
          abstractions to the unikernels. For example, a traditional VM might
          hotplug a vCPU; while a MirageOS application would request a "VM create"
          using the cloud API and "connect" the new instance to the existing
          network. We should be able to spin up 1000s of "CPUs" by using such
          APIs in a cluster environment.

          As well as helping Xen/Mirage, the public cloud API bindings will be
          very useful to other people in other contexts -- a nice side-effect.

          Improving the compiler testing process using code coverage tools.
          The core OCaml system has a large test suite, and it would be very
          useful to see which parts of the system are tested more actively
          and which are not so. Developers will be helped to see where it is
          needed to add new tests, and in the process of improving coverage,
          it is possible to find unexplored bugs and fix them.
          It might help to make OCaml and its libraries more reliable.

          Usually, the output messages from the compiler are a bit more difficult to read for a machine,
          hence it's more time consuming to find the warnings, errors, etc., and their origin. By producing
          a structured output for compiler messages, other tools can more easily interoperate with them and
          provide tooling on top of the messages.

          frontend for the website. This may include presenting the data as a GraphQL endpoint with the frontend
          querying that endpoint using GraphQL.

          We currently have no visibility on the performance of the server serving

          To offer some visibility, we can implement a basic monitoring dashboard
          that would provide Metrics such as: Memory, CPU, Open file descriptors,
          Statistics such as (check if GDPR compliant first!) Requested URIs,
          User agents, Language, Logs.
          This project consists of mostly two parts: a frontend and a backend.
          The backend consists of building a high-level library to collect data
          and get statistics on them. The frontend will use this library to display
          graphs of the metrics, statistics, and other data we want to collect.

      - title: "Improve the OCaml Meta-Programming Ecosystem"
        description: >
          It's common for programming languages to provide some way to meta-program
          in order to preprocess code before reaching the last compilation step,
          for example, in the form of macros or templates. The OCaml compiler
          doesn't provide a full built-in macro system, but the OCaml parser does
          provide syntax for preprocessing purposes: attributes and extension points.
          We -the OCaml community- also have an official framework, called
          `ppxlib`, to write preprocessors -called PPXs- based on that syntax and
          integrate them into the compilation process.

          However, it's on the OCaml community to write and provide important PPXs
          to the OCaml developers. We've noticed that having the most important
          PPXs under the official PPX GitHub organisation -next to `ppxlib`- is
          helpful. Developers can easily find them; developers can trust them;
          and they're well-written and hygienic, so developers can use them as
          how-to guides for writing other PPXs. In this project, you'll write
          one or some of those official standard PPXs.

          Support `.eml` files in OCaml's VSCode extension
          Dream, the OCaml web framework, uses `.eml` files to embed HTML in
          OCaml files. At the moment, opening these files in VSCode, with the
          official OCaml VSCode extension, will not provide any syntax
          highlighting or diagnostics for the `.eml` files, because they are
          not supported.
          The goal of the project is to add support for the syntax in the
          extension itself as a first step, and eventually, add support for
          the language in the OCaml Language Server (LSP) as a second step.

        description: >
          OCaml 5.0 will be live soon! It ships with support for shared-memory parallelism and concurrency
          OCaml has missed all these years. This will be accompanied by a robust set of Multicore libraries
          useful for parallel programming. The Multicore compiler and libraries are under active development
          and will continue to evolve as the OCaml ecosystem moves towards Multicore.

          For assessing the impact of new features in the OCaml compiler and Multicore libraries, we have a
          set of sequential and parallel benchmarks present in our benchmark suite. While the sequential benchmarks
          contain many real-world applications, a wider set of parallel benchmarks would be useful.

          This project entails gathering the parallel benchmarks available at various places like
          https://github.com/ckoparkar/ocaml-benchmarks and making them available in the benchmark suite.

          Also multiple errors could not be reported at the same time there were multiple failing rewriters as just the first raising rewriter
          will raise, and the compilation process stops there. But now, a raising rewriter does not stop the preceding rewriter from running, allowing multiple
          to be raised both in the context-free phase and all the other phases.

        description: >
          OCaml is an industrial-strength functional programming language that's
          been around for nearly three decades.


          While functional programming itself is not new, it has not dominated
          mainstram programming languages. Recently, more mainstram languages
          have been adopting concepts from functional programming. Now more than
          ever is a good time to have various types of learning material
          pertaining to functional programming.


          Creative coding is a type of computer programming that focuses on
          generating artistic, expressive, and creative outputs using software
          and digital tools. It has its applications in places such as game
          development. Above all, it is a great pedagogical tool that gives
          visual outputs to its readers.


          Joy is a tiny creative coding library in Python. Joy builds heavily on
          functional programming concepts with very little reference to Python
          syntax.


          This project aims to implement a geometric creative coding library in
          OCaml. It is heavily inspired by Joy. When done, it will serve as a
          means to do geometric creative coding in OCaml.

          OCaml is a powerful, statically-typed programming language known for
          its efficiency and expressiveness. OCaml.org serves as the central hub
          for the OCaml community, providing resources, documentation, and news.
          In today's digital age, users expect a more personalised and
          comfortable web experience. One such expectation is the availability
          of a dark mode, which has become a popular feature on websites and
          applications. This project outlines the plan to implement a dark mode
          for OCaml.org, enhancing user experience and modernising the platform.
          As OCaml continues gaining traction in various industries, it is
          essential to modernise its online presence to meet users' expectations
          worldwide.


          The current styles and colors for light mode already exist so
          implementing a dark mode will involve adding contrasting colors and
          styles according to the Figma design. It will also consider accessibility
          standards and create a button that toggles between the light
          and dark mode.

          Inspired by [Rust's "Are we GUI yet?"](https://areweguiyet.com/), we want the same work done on the
          OCaml GUI libraries. A similar work has been done for the OCaml web
          libraries: ["Is OCaml web yet?"](https://ocaml.org/docs/is-ocaml-web-yet) (see the pull request). This work would
          allow to tackle "Are we game yet?" in the future.


          The survey must take into account the targeted platforms of these
          libraries, dependencies, (in)compatibilities, features, last updates,
          etc. A list is available in OCamlVerse but is not complete or detailed
          enough. Interns having previous knowledge of GUI libraries available
          in other languages can also compare them to the equivalent OCaml
          libraries.


          This work must result in a guide on OCaml.org, similar to the ["Is OCaml web yet?"](https://ocaml.org/docs/is-ocaml-web-yet) page.

          There's probably more. Each set of exercises uses a different execution
          framework (such as Jupyter, Learn-OCaml, or custom). They provide a range of user
          experiences, from available solutions up to candidate solution testing. The internship's main
          goal is to build a common configuration that allows running
          each set of exercises in most known setups. This will have the following
          benefits:

          - Exercises are no longer tied to a specific setup, they can be used in several
          - Loose coupling between the learning content and the technical setup
          - For learners: Feature parity among exercise sets, self-learning, unique, simple, and quick start
          - For teachers: Focus on exercise writing, using the common setup
          - For the community: More exercices, easier startup, improved learning curve for OCaml

          The goal is not to have all exercises from all the projects in all the setups.
          Instead, the goal is to show it is possible to do it. However, this will be
          established by porting a meaningful fraction of each exercise group into several
          setups or forks, if required.

          As a design constraint, we want to provide exercises at https://ocaml.org/. We
          consider automatically processing exercise groups to generate the
          https://ocaml.org/exercises page. The common setup should allow that, although
          it is not part of the internship.

      - title: Experimenting with an accessible diff viewer
        description: >
          Looking at the difference between two files is one of the most common
          activity in open source work.  It happens when reviewing a pull
          request, inspecting a commit and in many other situation.

          However, reading such diff is not always easy. Many tools have been to
          made to improve the situation and make the diff reviewing easier: The
          use of colours to distinguish between added and removed lines
          (traditionally green and red), use of a bold face to get the attention
          on the modified part of the line at the word level, the display of the
          two files side-by-side, ...

          However, most of the improvements mentioned above:

          - Are made for "generic" diffing of files. Some files may have very long lines and be unsuitable for the current diff output.
          - Are restricted to sighted people.

          The goal of this project is to develop a visualization tool on top of
          Git diff. The visualization tool is a terminal UI, and the main task
          of the internship is to make it highly accessible to screen readers.

      - title: Structural Diffing Algorithm for OCaml Libraries API
        description: >
          OCaml is a functional programming language. As with most languages, users
          eventually package bits of their code into libraries so that others may also
          benefit from their work. Those libraries evolve through time and multiple
          versions are released along the way, each with its own set of changes. Some
          changes are transparent to the library users, such as bug fixes that improve
          a faulty behaviour. Some others modify the interface of the library: its API,
          i.e. the set of types, values and functions it provides, sometimes requiring
          its users to change parts of their code to adapt.

          As libraries grow in size and complexity, it can become difficult for
          maintainers to keep track of how a change in their codebase impacts the public
          API.

          [ocaml-api-watch](https://github.com/NathanReb/ocaml-api-watch) is a fresh
          project that aims at providing a suite of tools to help OCaml library
          maintainers and users deal with changes in the public API of their libraries or
          the ones they use. This includes tools to detect potentially unwanted breaking
          changes before releasing a new version or to determine the version of a library
          that introduced a new function.

          The first prototype of the api diffing tool was completed during the previous
          outreachy round.
          The goal of the internship this time will be to extend the prototype to support
          a wider part of the OCaml interface representation and to implement a proper
          structural diffing algorithm.

      - title: "Claudius: a fantasy console in OCaml"
        description: >
          Claudius is a "fantasy console" library for OCaml, designed to make
          it fun and easy for people to make retro-style animated graphics or
          games for art or fun. Similar in aim to TIC-80 or PICO-8, and to a
          lesser extent Love2D, projects that use Lua.

          The original aim was to make it easy for people to have a fun way to
          learn OCaml (myself included) by making it easy to make fun on screen
          visuals. Since then it's been used for generative art projects and
          for even giving talks as an interactive prestation system!

          The idea is Claudius takes care of a lot of the heavy graphics work,
          and where possible encourages a functional way of thinking, rather
          than just copying TIC-80 etc. wholesale. The aim is to make it easy
          to be creative and explore - the "retro" style limitations are a part
          of that, as retro graphics competitions are very levelling at a
          community level - the gap between what old hands can do and new folk
          is much smaller, so promotes more open sharing hopefully (as
          examplified in the FieldFX/LoveByte communities).

      - title: "Extend Dune to Discover System Information"
        description: >
          Dune needs to know information about the current system (OS,
          architecture, etc) to perform many of its operations. Currently dune
          learns this information by invoking the compiler however this means that
          the compiler needs to be installed in order for dune to function
          correctly. One of dune's goals in to be the entry point for ocaml
          development, meaning it will be the first ocaml tool you install, but
          this means it to function correctly without the compiler.

          This project is to extend dune to allow it to learn all the necessary
          information about the current machine without the help of the compiler.
          This will probably involve looking inside the compiler's source code to
          figure out how it learns about the current machine, and modifying dune
          to use these same mechanisms.
