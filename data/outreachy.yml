        description: >
          MirageOS (see http://xenproject.org/developers/teams/mirage-os.html,
          http://www.openmirage.org/) is a type-safe unikernel written in OCaml
          which generates highly specialised "appliance" VMs that run directly
          on Xen without requiring an intervening kernel. A MirageOS
          application typically runs via several communicating kernel instances
          on the cloud. Today these instances are difficult to manage; we would
          like to explore strategies for managing these distributed
          computations using common public cloud APIs such as those exposed by
          Amazon EC2 and Rackspace.

          First we need to create pure OCaml API bindings for (e.g.) EC2 and
          Rackspace (purity is needed to ensure portability). These API
          bindings can then be used to provide operating-system-level
          abstractions to the unikernels. For example, a traditional VM might
          hotplug a vCPU; while a MirageOS application would request a "VM create"
          using the cloud API and "connect" the new instance to the existing
          network. We should be able to spin up 1000s of "CPUs" by using such
          APIs in a cluster environment.

          As well as helping Xen/Mirage, the public cloud API bindings will be
          very useful to other people in other contexts -- a nice side-effect.

          Improving the compiler testing process using code coverage tools.
          The core OCaml system has a large test suite, and it would be very
          useful to see which parts of the system are tested more actively
          and which are not so. Developers will be helped to see where it is
          needed to add new tests, and in the process of improving coverage,
          it is possible to find unexplored bugs and fix them.
          It might help to make OCaml and its libraries more reliable.

        description: >
          Usually, the output messages from the compiler are a bit more difficult to read for a machine,
          hence it's more time consuming to find the warnings, errors, etc., and their origin. By producing
          a structured output for compiler messages, other tools can more easily interoperate with them and
          provide tooling on top of the messages.

          Opam is the source-based package manager for OCaml code. This project comprises of writing a new web

          which provides information about packages that would provide metadata about the packages. We can extend
          this JSON metadata to include all the opam packages (not just the top 10) and use that to power a search
          frontend for the website. This may include presenting the data as a GraphQL endpoint with the frontend
          querying that endpoint using GraphQL.

          We currently have no visibility on the performance of the server serving
          v3.ocaml.org, which pages are most visited, if errors happen, etc.
          To offer some visibility, we can implement a basic monitoring dashboard
          that would provide Metrics such as: Memory, CPU, Open file descriptors,
          Statistics such as (check if GDPR compliant first!) Requested URIs,
          User agents, Language, Logs.
          This project consists of mostly two parts: a frontend and a backend.
          The backend consists of building a high-level library to collect data 
          and get statistics on them. The frontend will use this library to display
          graphs of the metrics, statistics, and other data we want to collect.

      - title: "Improve the OCaml Meta-Programming Ecosystem"
        description: >
          It's common for programming languages to provide some way to meta-program
          in order to preprocess code before reaching the last compilation step,
          for example, in the form of macros or templates. The OCaml compiler
          doesn't provide a full built-in macro system, but the OCaml parser does
          provide syntax for preprocessing purposes: attributes and extension points.
          We -the OCaml community- also have an official framework, called
          `ppxlib`, to write preprocessors -called PPXs- based on that syntax and
          integrate them into the compilation process.

          However, it's on the OCaml community to write and provide important PPXs
          to the OCaml developers. We've noticed that having the most important
          PPXs under the official PPX GitHub organisation -next to `ppxlib`- is
          helpful. Developers can easily find them; developers can trust them;
          and they're well-written and hygienic, so developers can use them as
          how-to guides for writing other PPXs. In this project, you'll write
          one or some of those official standard PPXs.

        description: >
          Support `.eml` files in OCaml's VSCode extension
          Dream, the OCaml web framework, uses `.eml` files to embed HTML in
          OCaml files. At the moment, opening these files in VSCode, with the
          official OCaml VSCode extension, will not provide any syntax
          highlighting or diagnostics for the `.eml` files, because they are
          not supported.
          The goal of the project is to add support for the syntax in the
          extension itself as a first step, and eventually, add support for
          the language in the OCaml Language Server (LSP) as a second step.

        description: >
          OCaml 5.0 will be live soon! It ships with support for shared-memory parallelism and concurrency
          OCaml has missed all these years. This will be accompanied by a robust set of Multicore libraries
          useful for parallel programming. The Multicore compiler and libraries are under active development
          and will continue to evolve as the OCaml ecosystem moves towards Multicore.

          For assessing the impact of new features in the OCaml compiler and Multicore libraries, we have a
          set of sequential and parallel benchmarks present in our benchmark suite. While the sequential benchmarks
          contain many real-world applications, a wider set of parallel benchmarks would be useful.

          This project entails gathering the parallel benchmarks available at various places like
          https://github.com/ckoparkar/ocaml-benchmarks and making them available in the benchmark suite.

          Every operating system, even unikernels, need a way to persist data accross reboots. Having persistent storage capabilities in MirageOS is

          and a simple, intuitive, and programmatic way to interact with these storage devices from a user's view point. This project pushes this vision
          one step further by building a library for GPT partitioning.

          In the past, when 'ppxlib' encountered an exception in a transformation, it stopped the rewriting process, causing the rewriters after to not be processed.
          Also multiple errors could not be reported at the same time there were multiple failing rewriters as just the first raising rewriter 
          will raise, and the compilation process stops there. But now, a raising rewriter does not stop the preceding rewriter from running, allowing multiple
          to be raised both in the context-free phase and all the other phases.

          single-purpose virtual machine images designed for specific applications, and it is written in OCaml.
          The project focussed on implementing the rtpMIDI protocol for serialising-deserialising of MIDI messages over Ethernet and implementing use cases like
          a publisher-subcriber based server-client model for MIDI messages.
