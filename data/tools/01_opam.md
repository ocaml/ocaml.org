`opam` is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and a Git-friendly development workflow. Managing your OCaml installation can be as simple as:

```sh
    opam list -a         # List the available packages
    opam install lwt     # Install LWT
    opam update          # Update the package list
    ...
    opam upgrade         # Upgrade the installed packages to their latest version
```
