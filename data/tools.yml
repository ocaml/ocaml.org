    synopsis: Executable code blocks inside markdown files
    description: >
      `ocaml-mdx` allows to execute code blocks inside markdown files.
      There are (currently) two sub-commands, corresponding
      to two modes of operations: pre-processing (`ocaml-mdx pp`)
      and tests (`ocaml-mdx test`).

      The pre-processor mode allows to mix documentation and code,
      and to practice "literate programming" using markdown and OCaml.

      The test mode allows to ensure that shell scripts and OCaml fragments
      in the documentation always stays up-to-date.

      `ocaml-mdx` is released as two binaries called `ocaml-mdx` and `mdx` which are
      the same, mdx being the deprecate name, kept for now for compatibility.

  - name: dune
    source: https://github.com/ocaml/dune
    license: MIT
    synopsis: Fast, portable, and opinionated build system
    description: >
      dune is a build system that was designed to simplify the release of
      Jane Street packages. It reads metadata from "dune" files following a
      very simple s-expression syntax.

      dune is fast, has very low-overhead, and supports parallel builds on
      all platforms. It has no system dependencies; all you need to build
      dune or packages using dune is OCaml. You don't need make or bash
      as long as the packages themselves don't use bash explicitly.

      dune supports multi-package development by simply dropping multiple
      repositories into the same directory.

      It also supports multi-context builds, such as building against
      several opam roots/switches simultaneously. This helps maintaining
      packages across several versions of OCaml and gives cross-compilation
      for free.

      the "Parsetree".

      It also comes bundled with two ppx rewriters that are commonly used to
      write tools that manipulate and/or generate Parsetree values;
      `ppxlib.metaquot` which allows to construct Parsetree values using the
      OCaml syntax directly and `ppxlib.traverse` which provides various
      ways of automatically traversing values of a given type, in particular
      allowing to inject a complex structured value into generated code.

  - name: ocp-indent

    synopsis: A simple tool to indent OCaml programs
    description: >
      Ocp-indent is based on an approximate, tolerant OCaml parser and a simple stack
      machine ; this is much faster and more reliable than using regexps. Presets and
      configuration options available, with the possibility to set them project-wide.
      Supports most common syntax extensions, and extensible for others.

      Includes:
      - An indentor program, callable from the command-line or from within editors
      - Bindings for popular editors
      - A library that can be directly used by editor writers, or just for
        fault-tolerant/approximate parsing.

    description: >
      OASIS generates a full configure, build and install system for your application. It starts with a simple _oasis file at the toplevel of your project and creates everything required.

      OASIS leverages existing OCaml tooling to perform most of it's work. In fact, it might be more appropriate to think of it as simply the glue that binds these other subsystems together and coordinates the work that they do. It should support the following tools:

      - OCamlbuild
      - OMake
      - OCamlMakefile (todo),
      - ocaml-autoconf (todo)

      It also features a do-it-yourself command line invocation and an internal configure/install scheme. Libraries are managed through findlib. It has been tested on GNU Linux and Windows.

      It also allows to have standard entry points and description. It helps to integrates your libraries and software with third parties tools like OPAM.

    license: LGPLv2
    synopsis: Camlp4 is a system for writing extensible parsers for programming languages
    description: >
      It provides a set of OCaml libraries that are used to define grammars as well
      as loadable syntax extensions of such grammars. Camlp4 stands for Caml
      Preprocessor and Pretty-Printer and one of its most important applications is
      the definition of domain-specific extensions of the syntax of OCaml.

      Camlp4 was part of the official OCaml distribution until its version 4.01.0.
      Since then it has been replaced by a simpler system which is easier to maintain
      and to learn: ppx rewriters and extension points.
