    Overview by David:



    server-reason-react implements react-dom/server and some of React''s internals
    in OCaml. Its purpose is to natively render HTML markup from the server for a
    Reason React application. This pushes the idea for universal code (sharing code
    between the browser and native) and this talk is the story of all of this, and
    what are the solutions we applied at Ahrefs.

    Overview by Sudha:


    In a first, OCaml 5.0 shipped with native support for parallelism and concurrency.
    This was a multi-year effort by the Multicore team and the OCaml development team
    that culminated in OCaml 5.0. The most challenging aspect was designing a multicore-capable
    garbage collector that remains backwards compatible in terms of features, performance,
    and latency. This is described in the paper ''Retrofitting Parallelism onto OCaml,''
    which appeared in ICFP 2020. In this talk, we will explore the ideas presented
    in the paper through doodle illustrations and zines.

  description: 'Hannes Mehnert''s FUN OCaml 2024 talk recording!


    Overview by Hannes:



    OCaml is a great systems programming language. We use it since more than a decade
    to develop MirageOS unikernels: run OCaml as a virtual machine, no Linux kernel
    involved. Since OCaml is statically typed (and type safe), and memory safe, we
    use a single address space, and avoided a lot of complexity of general purpose
    operating systems. Security-wise this is excellent: less attack surface, fewer
    attack vectors. Also less resource-heavy than contemporary OS. The result are
    tiny unikernels (e.g. a firewall with ~3MB as the full virtual machine image)
    that only contain the code really needed. I''ll present what MirageOS is today
    and where it is used, its future, and our learnings so far.

    I am the author of dmtrKovalenko/odiff which claims to be and it is the fastest
    in the world (on my banchmarks lol) implementation of the pixel-by-pixel image
    comparison library which is written in OCaml (and a little bit of C). This is
    a story about standing the project. Why not to write it in C or Rust? How do we
    tune the garbage collector to avoid major collections at all? All this and much
    more like the hidden superpower of unboxed floats and some challenges about naked
    pointers and upgrading to OCaml v5 in my talk!

    Overview by Eduardo:



    Traditionally GADT''s are used for lightweight tasks as the code complexity increases
    quite. I will be arguing that this is mostly a lack of common "design patterns"
    and maybe some tools. The talk will go through describing what you can fundamentally
    do with GADT''s, how you should think about them and a general technique to mimic
    dependent types in OCaml, Hopefully by the end, a show case of a proposal for
    the Michelson interpreter.

    functional programming language reshaped my approach to problem-solving, coding
    practices, and overall mindset about programming. Beyond the technical skills,
    OCaml connected me with incredibly bright, kind, and talented mentors and peers
    who have become lifelong friends. This journey also paved the way for my success
    on Twitch, allowing me to share my passion and knowledge with a broader audience.
    Join me as I explore the personal and professional growth that OCaml facilitated
    and celebrate the community that made it possible.

    levels of abstraction: tensor node assignments, optimized C-language-like programs,
    translations to actual C (for CPUs, or CUDA but it is still work-in-progress).
    Lastly, we will parallelize training across multiple devices.

    Overview by Michael:



    Each year the demo community run Tiny Code Xmas - using fantasy consoles like
    TIC-80 and PICO-8 to teach people to do retro graphics effects and size coding.
    But I didn''t want to learn size coding, I wanted to learn OCaml! So for my first
    OCaml project I built a small fantasy console engine using OCaml, and implemented
    both Tiny Code Xmas and most of Genuary (generate art January) in it. In this
    talk I''ll show why demo coding suits functional programming, look at how I built
    my first OCaml library, and show some examples of generative art using it.

    Overview by Rizo:


    Signals and fine-grained reactivity are two popular concepts in the JavaScript
    world, thanks to their simplicity, ergonomics and excellent performance. What
    are signals? What is their type? How can we use them in OCaml? Let''s build a
    reactive UI library from scratch to find out! From simple callbacks, layers are
    added to support batching, resource cleanup and `let` syntax for composing effects.
    DOM interactions are implemented to allow predictable, minimal and efficient UI
    updates. Finally, helix is revealed, a library based on the presented reactivity
    principles. I review some examples and discuss how helix is used to implement
    real-world applications at Hyper and Tarides.

  description: 'This is the seventh in a series about locals in OCaml. This episode
    explains the challenges around tail-call optimization and how to keep local variables
    from escaping their region. I introduce the [@nontail] annotation to prevent tail-call
    optimization, which is often needed when writing code with locals.

    Olivier Nicole, Fabrice Buoro


    The possibility to write truly parallel OCaml code brings forth new possibilities
    of bugs. Among those, data races (concurrent accesses to the same data) are hard
    to detect and dangerous, as they are non-deterministic, possibly silent, and can
    lead to highly unexpected results. ThreadSanitizer (TSan) is an open-source library
    and program instrumentation pass to reliably detect data races at runtime. TSan
    has been instrumental in finding thousands of data races across many programming
    languages. We will describe the core principles of data race detection in TSan,
    explain why it was challenging to apply it to OCaml, and the adaptations needed
    to the runtime system. We plan to demo how you can already use it in your own
    code, and explain the limitations to be aware of.'

    We describe how to disable language and library features that should not be used

  description: "[OCaML'23] Less Power for More Learning: Restricting OCaml Features
    for Effective Teaching\n\nMax Lang, Nico Petzendorfer\n\nWe present a framework
    for sandboxing and restricting features of the OCaml programming language to effectively
    automate the grading of programming exercises, scaling to hundreds of submissions.
    We describe how to disable language and library features that should not be used
    to solve a given exercise. We present an overview of an implementation of a mock
    IO system to allow testing of IO-related exercises in a controlled environment.
    Finally, we detail a number of security considerations to ensure submitted code
    remains sandboxed, allowing automatic grading to be trusted without manual verification.
    The source code of our implementation is publicly available [1]. \n[1] As a git
    repository at https://github.com/just-max/less-power."

    Andrew Tao


    I present my implementation of a parallel sequences abstraction that utilizes
    the support for shared memory parallelism in the new OCaml 5.0.0 multicore runtime.
    This abstraction allows clients to create highly parallelizable programs without
    needing to write, or even understand, the low-level implementation details necessary
    to parallelize large tasks.'

    Flambda 2 is an IR and optimisation pass for OCaml centred around inlining. We
    discuss the engineering constraints that shaped it and the overall structure that
    allows the compiler to be fast enough to handle very large industrial code bases.'

    2013 with the release of opam 1.0, to today where it stands as a robust toolchain
    for OCaml developers. We review the last three years in detail, emphasizing the
    advancements and innovations that have shaped the OCaml development landscape
    and highlighting key milestones such as the migration to Dune as the primary build
    system, and the development of a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for OCaml.
    \nWe also outline our plan for the coming years. The roadmap is informed by community
    feedback, discussions with Platform tool maintainers, and insights from industrial
    users of OCaml. The final version of this evolving roadmap, designed to shape
    the future of the OCaml developer experience, will be presented at the International

  description: 'At Jane Street, we enjoy using OCaml for lots of different things,
    from FPGA designs to web development. When it comes to Machine Learning, Python
    is one of the most commonly used languages. Machine learning frameworks such as
    TensorFlow or PyTorch wrap some highly efficient C++ and GPU implementations of
    tensor operations in easy to use Python apis. These frameworks also provide automatic
    differentiation functionalities which are commonly used to train deep learning
    models.


    In this talk we see how we can leverage TensorFlow or PyTorch directly from OCaml
    so that we can use our favorite programming language to build deep learning models
    and train them on GPUs. We will consider the Reinforcement Learning setting where
    an agent is trained to play Atari video games such as Space Invaders or Breakout.
    Our agents will be based on the Deep Q-Learning approach introduced in 2014.
