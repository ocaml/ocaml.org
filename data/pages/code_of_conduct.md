The OCaml development team and the user community are made up of a mixture of
professionals and volunteers from all over the world.
Diversity brings variety of perspectives that can be very valuable, but it can
also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. Therefore, we have a few
ground rules that we ask people to adhere to.
These rules apply equally to core developers (who should lead by example),
occasional contributors and those seeking help and guidance.
Their goal is that everyone feels safe and welcome when contributing to OCaml or
interacting with others in OCaml related forums.

These rules apply to the projects hosted in the
[GitHub OCaml organization](https://github.com/ocaml), the
[discuss.ocaml.org](https://discuss.ocaml.org/) forum, the
[caml-list@inria.fr](mailto:caml-list@inria.fr) mailing list, [OCaml
IRC](irc://irc.libera.chat:6697/#ocaml), [OCaml
discord](https://discord.gg/cCYQbqN), physical events like OCaml Workshop, and
any other OCaml-related space that adopted this Code of Conduct. A more
comprehensive list of spaces is available at the
[code-of-conduct](https://github.com/ocaml/code-of-conduct) GitHub repository.

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
  people of any origin, color, status, educational level, gender, sexual
  orientation, age, culture and beliefs, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate.**
  Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
  work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
  you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- **Be respectful.**
  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
  behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and
  then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
  It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable
  or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the OCaml development team
  and user community should be respectful when dealing with other members as
  well as with people outside the community.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.**
  Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment
  and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
  - Violent language or threats or personal insults have no chance to
    resolve a dispute or to let a discussion flourish. Worse, they can
    hurt durably, or generate durable fears. They are thus unwelcome.
  - Not everyone is comfortable with sexually explicit or violent
    material, even as a joke. In an online open multicultural world, you
    don't know who might be listening. So be cautious and responsible
    with your words.
  - Discussions are online and recorded for posterity; we all have our
    right for privacy and online gossiping as well as posting or threatening to
    post other people's personally identifying information is prohibited.
- **Remember that what you write in a public online forum might be read by
  many people you don't know.**
  Consider what image your words will give to outsiders of the development
  team / the user community as a whole. Try to avoid references to private
  knowledge to be understandable by anyone.
- **OCaml online forums are only to discuss OCaml-related subjects.**
  Unrelated political discussions or long digressions are unwelcome,
  even for illustration or comparison purposes.
- **When we disagree, try to understand why.**
  Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and OCaml is no
  exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
  constructively. Remember that we are different. Different people
  have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone
  holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong.
- **It is human to make errors, and please try not to take things personally.**
  Please do not answer aggressively to problematic behavior and simply
  signal the issue. If actions have been taken with you (e.g. bans or simple
  demands of apology, of rephrasing or keeping personal beliefs or troubles
  private), please understand that they are not intended as aggression or
  punishment ― even if they feel harsh to you ― but as ways to enforce a
  calm communication for the other participants and to give you the opportunity
  to change your behavior. We understand you may feel hurt, or maybe you had a
  bad day, so please take this opportunity to question yourself, cool down if
  necessary and do not persist in the exact same behavior you have been
  reported for.

## Enforcement ##

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing the OCaml Code of Conduct enforcement team at
<coc-help@ocaml.org> or, at your discretion, any member of the team.
Confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident will be maintained while dealing with it.

In particular, you should seek support from the team instead of dealing by
yourself with a behavior that you consider hurtful. This applies to members of
the enforcement team as well, who shouldn't deal by themselves with violations
in discussions in which they are a participant.

Depending on the violation, the team can choose to address a private or public
warning to the offender, request an apology, or ban them for a short or a long
period from interacting on one or all of our forums.

Except in case of serious violations, the team will always try a pedagogical
approach first (the offender does not necessarily realize immediately why their
behavior is wrong). We consider short bans to form part of the pedagogical
approach, especially when they come with explanatory comments, as this can give
some time to the offender to calm down and think about their actions.

The members of the team are currently:

- Louis Roché <[louis@ocaml.org](mailto:louis@ocaml.org)>
- Marcello Seri <[marcello@ocaml.org](mailto:marcello@ocaml.org)>
- Raja Boujbel <[raja@ocaml.org](mailto:raja@ocaml.org)>
- Simon Cruanes <[simon@ocaml.org](mailto:simon@ocaml.org)>
- Shon Feder <[shon@ocaml.org](mailto:shon@ocaml.org)>

## Strained Situations ##

We believe that participation in our community should not cause distress.
Communication can be difficult in online communities, and we recognize that
people may feel distressed even without a clear infraction of our standards. We
hope to make a community where discussing such situations personally with other
members can resolve such distress, but we recognize this may not always be
possible. If the Code of Conduct has not been violated but you wish to discuss
such an issue, please feel free to contact `coc-help@ocaml.org`.
