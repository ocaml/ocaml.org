Welcome to the April 2024 edition of the OCaml.org newsletter! This update has been compiled by the OCaml.org team. You can find [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/ocamlorg-newsletter) on Discuss.

Our goal is to make OCaml.org the best resource for anyone who wants to get started and be productive in OCaml. The OCaml.org newsletter provides an update on our progress towards that goal and an overview of the changes we are working on.

We couldn't do it without all the amazing people who help us review, revise, and create better OCaml documentation and work on issues. Your participation enables us to so much more than we could just by ourselves. Thank you!

This newsletter covers:
- **OCaml Cookbook:** We shipped a new, community-driven section in the Learn area. Help us make it really useful by contributing and reviewing recipes for common tasks!
- **Community & Marketing Pages Rework:** We have UI designs for the reworked and new pages of the community section and are starting work to implement these.
- **General Improvements:** As usual, we also worked on general maintenance and improvements, so we're highlighting some of the work that happened below.

## Open Issues for Contributors

You can find [open issues for contributors here](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+no%3Aassignee)!

Here's some new (and as of time of writing this newsletter still open) issues that were opened this month:

- Package Versions page is missing dark mode styles [ocaml/ocaml.org#2341](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/2341)  by [@sabine](https://github.com/sabine)
- (Data) Extend the Data Model of Academic Institution to Record Information about Course Materials [ocaml/ocaml.org#2328](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/2328)  by [@sabine](https://github.com/sabine)
  
## The OCaml Cookbook

We shipped a new, community-driven section in the Learn area: the OCaml Cookbook!

The OCaml Cookbook is a place where OCaml developers share how to solve common tasks using packages from the ecosystem.

A task is something that needs to be done inside a project. A recipe is a code sample and explanations on how to perform a task using a combination of open source libraries.

The Cookbook now live at [ocaml.org/cookbook](https://ocaml.org/cookbook), but there are not a lot of recipes published yet.

Here's how we need your help:

1. Help review [open pull requests for cookbook recipes](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3ACookbook)!
2. Contribute new recipes and tasks for the cookbook!
3. Suggest improvements to existing recipes and the UI.
