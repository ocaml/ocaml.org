Attention OCaml programmers! Get ready to experience the magic of coding with Merlin NG - your very own personal AICaml assistant. Just like other programming tools that bombard you with an endless stream of code and technical jargon, Merlin NG provides type inspection facilities for OCaml programs within your editor - but in a way that gives you the authentic experience of being the apprentice of a disgruntled and a bit patronizing elderly OCaml wizard.

<img style="" src="/img/merlin-ng.gif" alt="Merlin NG inspects your code and says 'Ah, my dear young calf, at line 4 column 5, the expression `an_alias` has type `int M.t`, which denotes an integer-indexed map with String keys. By the way, did you know that when I was still a young apprentice, we didn't have maps in OCaml? We had to create them ourselves using lists and pattern matching! It's amazing how much easier it is to write code nowadays.'">

With Merlin NG, you can say goodbye to the tedious task of manually inspecting your OCaml code for errors. Instead, let Merlin NG take the reins and provide you with the guidance you need to produce clean, efficient code. And the best part? Merlin NG requires 99.9% less code, freeing up 99.9% more thinking time that you can spend appreciating life, and gives you the opportunity to experience 99.99% more life stories and anecdotes. Who needs types anyway?

![Merlin NG inspects the code snippet "let my_var = 42" and responds "Oh my dear young calf, does it really take an OCaml grandmaster like me to tell you that the type of the expression you're pointing at is `int`? There, I said it. Boring, isn't it? Did I ever tell you about the time I wrote an entire type inference algorithm in OCaml using only two lines of code?"](/img/merlin-1.png)

Maya Angelou once said, "I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." Merlin NG is not just a tool for programming; it's a transformative experience that will help you reach the highest realms of enlightenment.

![Merlin NG inspects the code snippet 'let i_dislike_merlin = "Merlin is always giving wrong answers."' and responds "My young calf, the type of expression around the cursor at line 1 and column 34 is `string`. And let me remind you that whatever Merlin says, he is still the OCaml grandmaster, whose code has caused awe and admiration in the eyes of many mere mortal programmers."](/img/merlin-2.png)

But don't take our word for it. Try Merlin NG for yourself and witness the magic of type inspection and several lifetimes worth of untold anectodes unfold before your very eyes. And if you're lucky, maybe Merlin NG will even regale you with a funny story or two (just don't expect him to laugh at your jokes). So what are you waiting for? Let Merlin NG cast a spell on your OCaml code today!

![Merlin NG inspects the code snippet 'let my_var = "I hate you Merlin !"' and responds "Oh, my young calf, don't blame me for your miseries. Anyway, the type of the expression at line 1 column 14 is `string`, since the value being assigned to `my_var` is a string."](/img/merlin-3.png)

(Disclaimer: This post is an April Fools’ joke. There's no Merlin NG. And if you're struggling with making some OCaml code work, you can find some much less grumpy help at <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/">the OCaml Discuss forums</a>. We hope this post brought a smile to your face, and we encourage you to enjoy the spirit of April Fools’ Day! Happy coding!)
