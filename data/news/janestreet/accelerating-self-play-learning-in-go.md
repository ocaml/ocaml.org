<p>At Jane Street, over the last few years, weâ€™ve been increasingly exploring machine learning to improve our models. Many of us are fascinated by the rapid improvement we see in a wide variety of applications due to developments in deep learning and reinforcement learning, both for its exciting potential for our own problems, and also on a personal level of pure interest and curiosity outside of work.</p>
