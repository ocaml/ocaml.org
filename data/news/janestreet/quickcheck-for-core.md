<p>Automated testing is a powerful tool for finding bugs and specifying correctness
properties of code. Haskell’s Quickcheck library is the most well-known
automated testing library, based on over 15 years of research into how to write
property-base tests, generate useful sources of inputs, and report manageable
counterexamples. Jane Street’s Core library has not had anything comparable up
until now; version 113.00 of Core finally has a version of Quickcheck,
integrating automated testing with our other facilities like s-expression
reporting for counterexample values, and support for asynchronous tests using
Async.</p>
