<p>At Jane Street, our web UIs are built on top of an in-house framework
called <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incr_dom">Incr_dom</a>, modeled in
part on <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html">React’s virtual
DOM</a>. Rendering different
views efficiently in response to changes made to a shared model is a
quintessentially incremental computation—so it should be no surprise
that Incr_dom is built on top of
<a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental/">Incremental</a>.</p>
