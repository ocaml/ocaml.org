<p>With the external release of OCaml 4.07.0 imminent, we in Jane Street’s
Tools &amp; Compilers group have been planning what we want to work on for
inclusion in OCaml 4.08. These days OCaml uses (or at least attempts) a
time-based release process with releases scheduled every 6 months. We’re
trying to avoid rushing in changes at the last minute – as we’ve been
prone to do in the past – so this list is restricted to things we could
conceivably finish in the next 4-5 months.</p>
