<p>It’s time for our next
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/">Jane Street Tech Talk</a>. When
we’ve solicited suggestions for topics, one common request has been to
talk about our internal development process. Our next talk,
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/code-review/">How Jane Street Does Code Review</a>,
should fit the bill. The talk is being given by our own Ian Henry, and
discusses how we approach code review, and in particular how Iron, the
code review system we’ve been using and improving for some years now,
fits in to that process.</p>
