<p>When we set up a schedule on a computer, such as a list of commands to
run every day at particular times via Linux <a href="https://www.ostechnix.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cron-jobs">cron
jobs</a>, we
expect that schedule to execute reliably.  Of course weâ€™ll check the
logs to see whether the job has failed, but we never question whether
the cron daemon itself will function.  We always assume that it will,
as it always has done; we are not expecting mutiny in the ranks of the
operating system.</p>
