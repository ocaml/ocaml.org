Since version 4.10, OCaml offers a new best-fit memory allocator
alongside its existing default, the next-fit allocator. At Jane
Street, we've seen a big improvement after switching over to the new
allocator.

This post isn't about how the new allocator works. For that, the best
source is these notes from a talk by its
author.  Instead, this post is about just how tricky it is to compare two
allocators in a reasonable way, especially for a garbage-collected
system.
