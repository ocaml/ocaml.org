<p>Intern season is coming to a close, and it’s a nice time to look back
(as I’ve done in
<a href="/what-the-interns-have-wrought-rpc_parallel-and-core_profiler">previous</a>
<a href="/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2016">years</a>) and review some of what
the interns did while they were here. The dev intern program has grown
considerably, with almost 40 dev interns between our NY, London, and
Hong Kong offices.</p>
