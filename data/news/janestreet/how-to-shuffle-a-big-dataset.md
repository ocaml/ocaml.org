<p>At Jane Street, we often work with data that has a very low
signal-to-noise ratio, but fortunately we also have a <em>lot</em> of data.
Where practitioners in many fields might be accustomed to
having tens or hundreds of thousands of correctly labeled
examples, some of our problems are more like having a billion training
examples whose labels have only a slight tendency to be correct.
These large datasets present a number of interesting engineering
challenges.  The one we address here: <em>How do you shuffle a really
large dataset?</em>  (If youâ€™re not familiar with why one might need this,
