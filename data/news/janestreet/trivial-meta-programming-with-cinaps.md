<p>From now and then, I found myself having to write some mechanical and repetitive
code. The usual solution for this is to write a code generator; for instance in
the form of a ppx rewriter in the case of OCaml code. This however comes with a
cost: code generators are harder to review than plain code and it is a new
syntax to learn for other developers. So when the repetitive pattern is local to
a specific library or not widely used, it is often not worth the effort.
Especially if the code in question is meant to be reviewed and maintained by
several people.</p>
