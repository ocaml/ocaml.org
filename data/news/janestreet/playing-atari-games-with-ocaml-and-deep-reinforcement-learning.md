<p>In a <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/deep-learning-experiments-in-ocaml/">previous blog post</a>
we detailed how we used OCaml to reproduce some classical deep-learning results
that would usually be implemented in Python. Here we will do the same with
some Reinforcement Learning (RL) experiments.</p>
