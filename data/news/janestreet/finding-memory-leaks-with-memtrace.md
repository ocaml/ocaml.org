<p>Memory issues can be hard to track down. A function that only
allocates a few small objects can cause a space leak if itâ€™s called
often enough and those objects are never collected. Even then, many
objects are <em>supposed</em> to be long-lived. How can a tool, armed with data
on allocations and their lifetimes,
help sort out the expected from the suspicious?</p>
