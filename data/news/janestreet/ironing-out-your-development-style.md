give them cute names, like
<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme programming</a>,
<a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/">Agile</a>, and
<a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum">Scrum</a>; run
<a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/sgcal">conferences</a> and build
<a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community">communities</a> around them;
write
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503346126&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=extreme+programming">books</a>
that describe how to use them in excruciating detail; and
<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">manifestos</a> that lay out their
