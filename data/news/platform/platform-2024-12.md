Welcome to the thirteenth edition of the OCaml Platform newsletter!

In this September 2024 - January 2025 edition, we are excited to bring you the latest on the OCaml Platform, continuing our tradition of highlighting recent developments as seen in [previous editions](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/platform-newsletter). To understand the direction we're headed, especially regarding development workflows and user experience improvements, check out our [roadmap](https://ocaml.org/docs/platform-roadmap).

**Highlights:**
* **Dune Enables Cache By Default, Adds WebAssembly Support**
The latest Dune releases mark significant progress in build performance and language support. Version 3.17.0 enables the Dune cache by default for known-safe operations, improving build times for common tasks. The addition of Wasm_of_ocaml support opens new possibilities for OCaml projects targeting the web or other WebAssembly runtimes. In addition, Dune now supports adding Codeberg and GitLab repositories via the `(source)` stanza.
* **opam 2.3.0**
As announced with opam 2.2, opam releases are now time-based with a cadence of 6 months. Opam 2.3 has been released last November. It contains a major breaking change regarding extra-files handling: extra-files are now ignored when they are not present in the opam file. Previously they were silently added. This release adds also some new commands like `opam list --latest-only` or `opam install foo --verbose-on bar`, among other fixes and enhancements.
* **Improved Editor Workflows with OCaml-LSP and Merlin**
A major milestone for project-wide features has been reached with the release of OCaml 5.3: LSP's renaming feature now [_renames symbols in the entire project_](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-merlin-and-ocaml-lsp-support-experimental-project-wide-renaming/16008) if the index is built. Additionally,all of the classic merlin-server commands are now available as LSP custom requests: this enabled the addition of [many new features to the Visual Studio Code plugin](https://tarides.com/blog/2025-02-28-full-blown-productivity-in-vscode-with-ocaml/). Finally a brand new Emacs mode, based on LSP and the new custom queries is [now available on Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/ocaml-eglot).
* **Performance and Security Enhancements**
Recent updates across the platform focus on performance and reliability. Dune optimized its handling of .cmxs files, while opam implemented stricter git submodule error checking. OCaml-LSP resolved file descriptor leaks, contributing to a more stable development environment.

## **Dune**

**Roadmap:** [Develop / (W4) Build a Project](https://ocaml.org/docs/platform-roadmap#w4-build-a-project)

[Dune 3.17 was released](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-17/15770) with significant improvements to package management. Key features include binary distribution support, better error messages for missing packages, and Windows support without requiring OPAM.

The [Dune Developer Preview website](https://preview.dune.build) now provides editor setup instructions and package management tutorials.

Dune's package management features [were tested across hundreds of packages](https://dune.check.ci.dev/) in the opam repository, and a coverage tool was developed to track build success rates. For local development, Dune added support for building dependencies via `@pkg-install`, caching for package builds, and automated binary builds of development tools. The system supports both monorepo and polyrepo workflows, with options for installing individual dependencies or complete development environments.

The addition of [Wasm_of_ocaml support in Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11093) opens new possibilities for OCaml projects targeting the web or other WebAssembly runtimes. 

**Activities:**
- Updated preview website with editor setup instructions at https://preview.dune.build and published binary installer providing prebuilt Dune binaries
- [Enable dune cache by default](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10710)
- [Added wasm_of_ocaml support](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11093)
- Added support for [Codeberg](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10904) and [GitLab organizations](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10766) in the `(source)` stanza
- [Added support for `-H` compiler flag](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10644) enabling better semantics for `(implicit_transitive_deps false)`

## **Editor Tools**

**Roadmap:** [Edit / (W19) Navigate Code](https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap#w19-navigate-code), [Edit / (W20) Refactor Code](https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap#w20-refactor-code)

Developer tooling received substantial upgrades during the end of last year and the beginning 2025. A major milestone for project-wide features has been reached with the release of OCaml 5.3: LSP's renaming feature now [_renames symbols in the entire project_](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-merlin-and-ocaml-lsp-support-experimental-project-wide-renaming/16008) if the index is built. Additionally, all of the classic merlin-server commands are now available as LSP custom requests: this enabled the addition of [many new features to the Visual Studio Code plugin](https://tarides.com/blog/2025-02-28-full-blown-productivity-in-vscode-with-ocaml/) and the creation of a brand new Emacs mode, based on LSP, [now available on Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/ocaml-eglot).

These features bring OCaml editor support closer to modern IDE capabilities, with implementations available across multiple editors.

### Merlin and OCaml LSP Server

Support for project wide renaming, search-by-type, and ocaml-lsp-server now exposes all Merlin features via LSP custom queries.

**Notable Activity**

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed completion range issues with polymorphic variants ([ocaml-lsp#1427](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/issues/1427))
- Fixed various issues with jump code actions and added customization options ([ocaml-lsp#1376](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1376))
- Various fixes and improvements have been made to signature help and inlay hints

### Visual Studio Code plugin

Added support for most of the Merlin features historically availbale to Emacs and Vim users, via the new LSP custom requests.

## **Documentation Tools**

**Roadmap:** [Share / (W25) Generate Documentation](https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap#w25-generate-documentation)

### Odoc

**Maintained by:** Jon Ludlam (@jonludlam, Tarides), Daniel Bünzli (@dbuenzli), Jules Aguillon (@julow, Tarides), Paul-Elliot Anglès d'Auriac (@panglesd, Tarides), Emile Trotignon (@EmileTrotignon, Tarides, then Ahrefs) 

There is now a [beta release for odoc 3](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-odoc-3-beta-release/16043) that you can try out and give feedback on!

During the quarter, odoc has been making steady progress toward its 3.0 release with several notable improvements:
- **Enhanced Navigation**: The sidebar and breadcrumbs navigation has been unified and improved ([#1251](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1251)), making the documentation hierarchy more consistent and flexible. This allows better organization of modules, pages, and source files in the documentation.
- **Documentation Features**: New features have been added to Odoc 3 ([#1264](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1264)), including:
  - Support for images with embedded assets
  - Cross-package linking (linking to modules from external libraries)
- **Search Integration**: Sherlodoc, the search functionality, has been merged into the main odoc codebase ([#1263](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1263)), ensuring better maintenance and synchronized releases.

**Notable Activity**
- [[ANN] Odoc 3 Beta Release](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-odoc-3-beta-release/16043)

### Mdx upgraded to OCaml 5.3

**Maintained by:** Marek Kubica (@Leonidas-from-XIV, Tarides), Thomas Gazagnaire (@samoht, Tarides)

With OCaml 5.3, some compiler error messages changed, so MDX was updated to use a more expressive tag system to choose which version of the compiler can run which code block. This effort uncovered a bug in the current handling of skipped blocks for `mli` files, which was fixed.

**Notable Activity**
  - OCaml 5.3 support ([#457](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/pull/457)), ensuring the tool remains compatible with the latest OCaml releases.
  - Fixed error handling for skipped blocks in `mli` files ([#462](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/pull/462))
  - Improved syntax highlighting ([#461](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/pull/461))
  - Added support for multiple version labels ([#458](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/pull/458)), improving the ability to test code across different OCaml versions.
