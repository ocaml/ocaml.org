Welcome to the October 2021 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) monthly report! The [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) along with
this update have been compiled by me, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan.

As @octachron announced last month, the core team has [committed to an OCaml 5.0 release](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/the-road-to-ocaml-5-0/8584) next year with multicore and the effects runtime.  This month has seen tremendous activity in our multicore trees to prepare an upstream-friendly version, with a number of changes made to make the code ready for `ocaml/ocaml` and reduce the size of the diff. Recall that we have been feeding in multicore-related changes steadily since way [back in OCaml 4.09](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-prerequisite-patches-appearing-in-released-ocaml-compilers-now/4408), and so we are now down to the really big pieces.  Therefore the mainline OCaml trunk code is now being continuously being merged into our 5.00 staging branch, and test coverage has increased accordingly.

In the standard library, we continue to work and improve on thread safety by default. Since effect handlers are confirmed to go into 5.0 as well, they now have their own module in the stdlib as well. The multicore library ecosystem is also evolving with the changes to support OCaml 5.00, and in particular, Domainslib has had significant updates and improvements as more usecases build up. The integration of the Sandmark performance harness with current-bench is also actively being worked upon.

We would like to acknowledge the following people for their contribution:
* Török Edwin was able to reproduce the bug in `Task.pool` management
  [Domainslib#43](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/issues/43), and has also provided a PR to fix the same.
* Sid Kshatriya has created
  [PR#83](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/83) for `Eio` to use the Effect Handlers module.

Our focus in November is going to continue to be on relentlessly making a 5.0 staging tree, and we are preparing for a series of working groups with the core OCaml teams (taking up an entire week) to conduct preliminary code review on the full patchset. Stay tuned for how that has gone by the start of December!

As always, the Multicore OCaml updates are listed first, which contain the upstream efforts, merges with trunk, updates to test cases, bug fixes, and documentation improvements. This is followed by the ecosystem updates on Domainslib, `Tezos`, and `Eio`. The Sandmark and current-bench tasks are finally listed for your reference.

  Possible bug in `Task.pool` management

  Effect handlers have their own module now
  
  Sid Kshatriya has contributed a patch to rename
  `Obj.Effect_handlers` to `EffectHandlers` since effect handlers have
  their own module in Stdlib.

## Benchmarking

### Sandmark

#### Ongoing

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#248](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/248)
  Coq fails to build
  
  A new Coq tarball,
  [coq-multicore-2021-09-24](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq/releases/tag/multicore-2021-09-24),
  builds with Multicore OCaml 4.12.0+domains, but, `stdio.v0.14.0`
  fails to build cleanly with 4.14.0+trunk because of a [dune
  issue](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/5028) that has been
  reported.
  
* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#260](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/260)
  Add 5.00 branch for sequential run. Fix notebook.
    
  A new 5.00 OCaml variant branch has been added to Sandmark to
  track sequential benchmark runs in the CI.
    
#### Completed

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#256](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/256)
  Remove old variants
  
  The older variants, `4.05.*`, `4.06.*`, `4.07.*`, `4.08.*`,
  `4.10.0.*` have now been removed from Sandmark.
  
* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#258](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/258)  
  Document Makefile variables in README

  The README now contains documentation on the various Makefile
  variables that are used during building and execution of the
  benchmarks in Sandmark.

### current-bench

#### Ongoing

* [ocurrent/current-bench#117](https://github.com/ocurrent/current-bench/issues/117)
  Read stderr from the Docker container
  
  We would like to see any build failures from the benchmark execution
  inside the Docker container for debugging purposes.

* [ocurrent/current-bench#146](https://github.com/ocurrent/current-bench/issues/146)
  Replicate ocaml-bench-server setup
  
  The TAG and OCaml variants need to be abstracted from the Sandmark
  Makefile to current-bench in order to be able to run the benchmarks
  for different compiler versions and developer branches.

#### Completed

* [ocurrent/current-bench#105](https://github.com/ocurrent/current-bench/issues/105)
  Abstract out Docker image name from `pipeline/lib/pipeline.ml` to environments
  
  Custom Dockerfiles are now supported and hence you can pull in any
  opam image in the Dockerfile.

* [ocurrent/current-bench#119](https://github.com/ocurrent/current-bench/issues/119)
  `OCAML_BENCH_DOCKER_CPU` does not support range of CPUs for parallel execution
  
  The Docker CPU setting now uses a string representation instead of
  an integer to specify the list of CPUs for parallel execution.

* [ocurrent/current-bench#151](https://github.com/ocurrent/current-bench/issues/151)
  Docker versus native performance
  
  The Docker with current-bench, and native sequential and parallel
  benchmark runs do not show significant difference with
  hyper-threading disabled. The Gödel server configuration and the
  Sandmark-nightly notebook graph results are provided below for
  reference:
  
  - CPU: Intel(R) Xeon® Gold 5120 CPU @ 2.20 GHz
  - OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Focal Fossa)
  - Sandmark 2.0-beta branch: https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/tree/2.0-beta
  - Disabled hyper-threading:
    ```
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/active
    0
    ```
  - Memory (62 GB), disk (1.8 TB).
  - OCaml variant: 4.12.0+domains
  - Sandmark-nightly notebooks: https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark-nightly/tree/main/notebooks
  - Average of five iterations for each benchmark
    - `run_in_ci` for sequential
    - `macro_bench` for parallel
