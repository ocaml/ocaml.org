Welcome to the June 2020 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) report! As with [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly), many thanks to @shakthimaan and @kayceesrk for collating the updates for the month of June 2020. *This is an incremental update; new readers may find it helpful to flick through the previous posts first.*

This month has seen a tremendous surge of activity on the upstream OCaml project to prepare for multicore integration, as @xavierleroy and the core team have driven a number of initiatives to prepare the OCaml project for the full multicore featureset.  To reflect this, from next month we will have a status page on the ocaml-multicore wiki with the current status of both our multicore branch and the upstream OCaml project itself.

Why not from this month? Well, there's good news and bad news.  [Last month](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-ocaml-may-2020-update/5898), I observed that we are a PR away from most of the opam ecosystem working with the multicore branch.  The good news is that we are still a single PR away from it working, but it's a different one :-) The retrofitting of the `Threads` library has brought up [some design complexities](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/342), and so rather than putting in a "bandaid" fix, we are integrating a comprehensive solution that will work with system threads, domains and (eventually) fibres. That work has taken some time to get right, and I hope to be able to update you all on an opam-friendly OCaml 4.10.0+multicore in a few weeks.

Aside from this, there have been a number of other improvements going into the multicore branches: [mingw Windows support](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/351), [callstack improvements](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/363), [fixing the Unix module](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/346) and so on. The full list is in the detailed report later in this update.

## Sandmark benchmarks

A major milestone in this month has been the upgrade to the latest dune.2.6.0 to build Multicore OCaml 4.10.0 for the Sandmark benchmarking project. A number of new OPAM packages have been added, and the existing packages have been upgraded to their latest versions. The Multicore OCaml code base has seen continuous performance improvements and enhancements which can be observed from the various PRs mentioned in the report.

We would like to thank:

* @xavierleroy for working on a number of multicore-prequisite PRs to
  make stock OCaml ready for Multicore OCaml.
* @camlspotter has reviewed and accepted the camlimages changes
  and made a release of camlimages.5.0.3 required for Sandmark.
* @dinosaure for updating the decompress test benchmarks for Sandmark
  to build and run with dune.2.6.0 for Multicore OCaml 4.10.0.

A chapter on Parallel Programming in Multicore OCaml with topics on task pool, channels section, profiling with code examples is being written. We shall provide an early draft version of the document to the community for your valuable feedback.

## Papers

Our "Retrofitting Parallism onto OCaml" paper has been officially accepted at [ICFP 2020](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/track/icfp-2020-papers#event-overview) which will be held virtually between August 23-28, 2020. A [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11663) of the paper was made available earlier, and will be updated in a few days with the camera-ready version for ICFP.  Please do feel free to send on comments and queries even after the paper is published, of course.

Excitingly, another multicore-related paper on [Cosmo: A Concurrent Separation Logic for Multicore OCaml](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/publis/mevel-jourdan-pottier-cosmo-2020.pdf) will also be presented at the same conference.

The Multicore OCaml updates are first listed in our report, which are followed by improvements to the Sandmark benchmarking project. Finally, the changes made to upstream OCaml which include both the ongoing and completed tasks are mentioned for your reference.

## OCaml

### Ongoing

* [ocaml/ocaml#9541](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9541)
  Add manual page for the instrumented runtime

  The [instrumented runtime](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9082)
  has been merged to OCaml 4.11.0. A manual for the same has been
  created and is under review.


### Completed

* [ocaml/ocaml#9619](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9619)
  A self-describing representation for function closures

  The PR provides a way to record the position of the environment for
  each entry point for function closures.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9649](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9649)
  Marshaling for the new closure representation

  The `output_value` marshaler has been updated to use the new closure
  representation. There is no change required for the `input_value`
  unmarshaler.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9655](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9655)
  Introduce type Obj.raw_data and functions Obj.raw_field,
  Obj.set_raw_field to manipulate out-of-heap pointers

  The PR introduces a type `Obj.bits`, and functions `Obj.field_bits`
  and `Obj.set_field_bits` to read and write bit representation of
  block fields to support the no-naked-pointer operation.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9678](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9678)
  Reimplement Obj.reachable_word using a hash table to detect sharing

  The `caml_obj_reachable_words` now uses a hash table instead of
  modifying the mark bits of block headers to detect sharing. This is
  required for compatibility with Multicore OCaml.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9680](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9680)
  Naked pointers and the bytecode interpreter

  The bytecode interpreter implementation is updated to support the
  no-naked-pointers mode operation as required by Multicore OCaml.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9682](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9682)
  Signal handling in native code without the page table

  The patch uses the code fragment table instead of a page table
  lookup for signal handlers to know whether the signal came from
  ocamlopt-generated code.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9683](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9683)
  globroots.c: adapt to no-naked-pointers mode

  The patch considers out-of-heap pointers as major-heap pointers in
  no-naked-pointers mode for global roots management.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9689](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9689)
  Generic hashing for the new closure representation

  The hashing functions have been updated to use the latest closure
  representation from
  [ocaml/ocaml#9619](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9619) for the
  no-naked-pointers mode.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9698](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9698)
  The end of the page table is near

  The PR eliminates some of the use of the page tables in the runtime
  system when built with no-naked-pointers mode.

Our thanks to all the OCaml developers and users in the community for
their continued support and contribution to the project. Stay safe!
