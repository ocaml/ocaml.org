# Multicore OCaml: September 2020

Welcome to the September 2020 Multicore OCaml report! This update along with the [previous
monthly](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) updates have been compiled by @shakthimaan, @kayceesrk and @avsm.

Big news this month is that the [systhreads compatibility support](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/407) PR has been merged, which means that Dune (and other users of the `Thread` module) can compile out of the box.  You can now compile the multicore OCaml fork conveniently using the new `opam compiler` plugin ([see announcement](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-compiler-0-1-0/6442)):

```
opam update
opam compiler create "ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore:no-effect-syntax"
eval $(opam env)
```

This selects the branch of multicore OCaml that omits the experimental `effect` syntax, and thus works with the existing ppx ecosystem.  It's quite fun opam installing ecosystem packages and seeing them operate out of the box at long last. There are still a few rough edges to the thread compatibility support (mainly at the C compatibility layer, such as registering external C threads with the GC), but these will be worked out in the coming weeks. We'd like to hear of any build failures you encounter in the opam universe with this: please report them on https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues

A number of performance improvements to the multicore OCaml GC and the Sandmark benchmarking project have also been completed through September:
- we have now included the [Kronecker implementation](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/170) from the Graph500 benchmarks to Sandmark
- an [n-queen](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/173) benchmark addition is in progress
- benchmark runs now provide a count of the OCaml symbols as a code size metric
- work on building Tezos with multicore OCaml, and integration with the Sandmark
benchmarking test suite has also begun.

We have also begun an effort to [port Lwt](https://github.com/Sudha247/lwt-multicore/tree/preemptive-multicore) to take advantage of parallelism via `Lwt_preemptive`. [Code samples](https://github.com/Sudha247/code-samples/) and test runs have been performed, and Sudha has written [an introductory blog post](https://sudha247.github.io/2020/10/01/lwt-multicore/) about her early results.  Note that this work doesn't change the core behaviour of Lwt (a cooperative futures framework with no context switching between `bind` calls), but allows parallelism via explicit calls to background preemptive threads.

On the upstreaming efforts to OCaml, the 4.12 release will freeze earlier than usual in October, and so we finished submitting the last of the [garbage collector colour changes](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9756 ) and are aiming for the work on reliable safe points to go into OCaml 4.13.  There have been a lot of runtime changes packed into 4.12 already, and so we will issue a call for testing when the release candidate of 4.12 is cut.

Onto the details of the PRs. As with the previous updates, the Multicore OCaml updates are listed first, which are then followed by the enhancements to the Sandmark benchmarking project. The upstream OCaml ongoing and completed updates are finally mentioned for your reference.

## Multicore OCaml

### Ongoing

* [ocaml-multicore/domainslib#17](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/17)
  Implement channels using Mutex and Condition Variables

  The `lib/chan.ml` sources have been updated to implement channels
  using Mutex and Condition Variables, and a
  `LU_decomposition_multicore.exe` test has been added for the same.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#381](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/381)
  Reimplementating systhreads with pthreads

  This PR is actively being reviewed for the use of `pthreads` in
  Multicore OCaml. It introduces the Domain Execution Contexts (DEC)
  which allows multiple threads to run atop a domain.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#394](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/394)
  Changes to polling placement

  The polls placement is done at the start of the functions and on the
  back-edge of loops, instead of using Feely's algorithm. This is a
  work-in-progress.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#401](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/401)
  Do not handle interrupts recursively

  A domain local variable is introduced to prevent handling of
  interrupts recursively.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#402](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/402)
  Split handle_gc_interrupt into handling remote and polling sections

  A `caml_poll_gc_work` is introduced that has information of GC work
  done previously in `caml_handle_gc_interrupt`. This facilitates
  `stw_handler` to make calls to poll and not handle service
  interrupts, as it may lead to unwanted recursion.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#403](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/403)
  Segmentation fault when building Tezos on Multicore 4.10.0 with no-effects-syntax

  This is an on-going investigation on why the package
  `tezos-embedded-protocol-packer` in Tezos is causing a segmentation
  fault when building with Multicore OCaml.

### Completed

#### Domainslib

* [ocaml-multicore/domainslib#19](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/19)
  Finer grain signalling with mutex condvar for Channels

  The use of fine grain locking for Mutex and condition variables
  helps in improving the performance for larger cores, as against a
  single mutex for all the signalling.

#### Multicore OPAM

* [ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam#31](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam/pull/31)
  Patch dune.2.7.1 for Multicore OCaml

  The opam file for dune.2.7.1 has been added along with a patch to
  `bootstrap.ml` to get it working for Multicore OCaml, thanks to
  Chaitanya Koparkar.

* [ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam#32](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam/pull/32)
  Add ocamlfind-secondary dependency to dune

  The installation of `dune` requires `ocamlfind-secondary` as a
  dependency for dune.2.7.1, and has been added to the OPAM file.

#### Multicore OCaml

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#395](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/395)
  Move to SPIN_WAIT for all spins and usleep in SPIN_WAIT

  The PR provides the SPIN_WAIT macro for all the busy spin wait
  loops, and uses `caml_plat_spin_wait` when busy waiting. This
  ensures that the same spin strategy is used in different places in
  the code.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#397](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/397)
  Relaxation of backup thread signalling

  The signalling to the backup thread from the mutator thread when
  leaving a blocking section is modified. It reduces the potential
  Operating System scheduling when re-entering OCaml.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#400](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/400)
  Demux eventlog for backup thread

  The events in the backup thread were emitting the same process ID as
  the main thread, and this PR separates them.

![PR 400|690x246](https://discuss.ocaml.org/uploads/short-url/1k0ZG25zs4Vl8x9sIPXNlpBj3NX.png) 

  In the above illustration, the backup threads are active when the
  main thread is waiting on a condition variable.

## Benchmarking

### Ongoing

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#159](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/159)
  Implement a better way to describe tasklet cpulist

  We need a cleaner way to obtain the taskset list of cores for a
  benchmark run when we are provided with a number of domains. We
  should be able to specify hyper-threaded cores, NUMA zones to use,
  and the specific cores to use for the parallel benchmarks.

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#173](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/173)
  Addition of nqueens benchmark to multicore-numerical

  A draft version of the classical `n queens` benchmark has been added
  for review in Sandmark. This includes both the single and multicore
  implementation.

### Completed

* [ocaml-bench/ocaml_bench_scripts#11](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/ocaml_bench_scripts/pull/11)
  Add support for configure option and OCAMLRUNPARAM

  The `ocaml_bench_scripts` has been updated to support passing
  `configure` options and OCAMLRUNPARAM when building and running the
  benchmarks in Sandmark.

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#122](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/122)
  Measurements of code size

  The output .bench JSON file produced from the benchmarks now
  includes a code size metric for the number of CAML symbols. A sample
  benchmark output is shown below:

  ```json
  {"name":"knucleotide.", ... ,"codesize":276859.0, ...}
  ```

  The code size count for few of the benchmarks is given below:

  ```
  | Benchmark  |   Count   |
  |------------|-----------|
  | alt-ergo   | 2_822_040 |
  | coqc       | 5_869_305 |
  | cpdf       | 1_131_376 |
  | nbody.exe  |   276_710 |
  | stress.exe |    84_061 |
  | fft.exe    |    38_914 |
  ```

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#170](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/170)
  Graph500 SEQ

  The Graph500 benchmark with a Kronecker graph generator has now been
  added to Sandmark. The generator builds three kernels for graph
  construction, Breadth First Search, and Single Source Shortest
  Paths.

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#172](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/172)
  Remove `Base`, `Stdio` orun dependency for trunk

  The `orun` sources in Sandmark have been updated to remove the
  dependency on both `Base` and `Stdio`. They have been replaced with
  functions from `Stdlib`, `List`, `String` and `Str`.

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#174](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/174)
  Cleanup our use of sudo for chrt

  The use of `sudo` has been removed from the Makefile for running
  parallel benchmarks, to avoid creating output files and directories
  that require root permissions for access. The use of
  `RUN_BENCH_TARGET=run_orunchrt` will execute the benchmarks using
  `chrt -r 1`. The user can give permissions to the `chrt` binary
  using:

  ```
  $ sudo setcap cap_sys_nice=ep /usr/bin/chrt
  ```

## OCaml

### Ongoing

* [ocaml/ocaml#9876](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9876)
  Do not cache young_limit in a processor register

  The PR removes the caching of `young_limit` in a register for ARM64,
  PowerPC and RISC-V ports, as it is problematic during polling for
  signals and inter-domain communication in Multicore OCaml.

### Completed

* [ocaml/ocaml#9756](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9756)
  Garbage collectors colour change

  The gray colour scheme in the Garbage Collector has been removed to
  facilitate merging with the Multicore OCaml collector. The existing
  benchmarks in Sandmark suite that did overflow the mark stack are
  show in the below illustration, and there is little negative impact
  on the change.

![PR-9756|690x495](https://discuss.ocaml.org/uploads/short-url/2nIsxMaEnUPpk8CJIjwI6UeT9yp.png) 

As always, we would like to thank all the OCaml developers and users in the community for their continued support and contribution to the project.  Be well!
