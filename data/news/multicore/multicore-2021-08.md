# Multicore OCaml: August 2021

Welcome to the August 2021 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) monthly report! The following update and the [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) have been compiled by me, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan. This month's update is a bit quieter as August is also a period of downtime in Europe (and our crew in India also took well-deserved time off), but we all participated in the [online OCaml Workshop](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-workshop-2021-live-stream/8366) which was held virtually this year, so there are plenty of videos to watch!

The multicore effort is all on track for integration into OCaml 5.0 early next year, with the core team currently organising the upstreaming code review strategy over the coming winter months.  Meanwhile, there are some blog posts and videos from the OCaml Workshop which give more detailed updates on both domains-parallelism and effects. 

* **Adapting the OCaml ecosystem for Multicore OCaml**
  - *This talk covers how our community can adapt to the forthcoming OCaml 5.0 with parallelism.*
  - [Blog post 1](http://segfault.systems/blog/2021/adapting-to-multicore/), [Blog post 2](https://tarides.com/blog/2021-08-26-tarides-engineers-to-present-at-icfp-2021)
  - [Video](https://watch.ocaml.org/videos/watch/629b89a8-bbd5-490d-98b0-d0c740912b02)
* **Parafuzz coverage guided Property Fuzzing for Multicore OCaml programs**
  - *We develop ParaFuzz, an input and concurrency fuzzing tool for Multicore OCaml programs. ParaFuzz builds on top of Crowbar which combines AFL-based grey box fuzzing with QuickCheck and extends it to handle parallelism.*
  - [Video](https://watch.ocaml.org/videos/watch/c0d591e0-91c9-4eaa-a4d7-c4f514de0a57)
* **Experiences with Effects**
  - *The multicore branch of OCaml adds support for effect handlers. In this talk, we report our experiences with effects, both from converting existing code, and from writing new code.*
  - [Video](https://watch.ocaml.org/videos/watch/74ece0a8-380f-4e2a-bef5-c6bb9092be89)

As always, the Multicore OCaml updates are listed first, which are then followed by the updates from the Ecosystem libraries and Sandmark benchmarking.

  The README.md file has been updated to point to the sample programs in the master branch that use the new `num_additional_domains` argument label.

* The Multicore OCaml concurrency bug detection tool named  [ParaFuzz](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/parafuzz) is now available in GitHub as Free/Libre and Open Source Software.

* Tezos is a proof-of-stake distributed consensus platform designed to evolve, and is written in OCaml. The version of the [Tezos](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/tezos) daemon that now runs on Multicore OCaml is also available in GitHub as a work-in-progress fork.

#### Eio

The `eio` library provides an effects-based parallel IO stack for
Multicore OCaml.

##### Completed

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#68](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/68)
  Add eio_luv backend
  
  We now use `luv`, which has OCaml/Reason bindings to libuv, to
  provide a cross-platform default backend for eio.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#72](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/72)
  Add non-deterministic to abstract domain socket test
  
  The inclusion of `non-deterministic=command` to disable a regular
  `dune runtest` for the failing abstract domain socket test.

  Don't crash when receiving a signal
  
  A patch to receive a signal and not crash in
  `lib_eio_linux/eio_linux.ml`.

  Add Eio.Stream
  
  The `Stream` module has been added to Eio that implements bounded
  queues with cancellation.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#76](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/76)
  Link to some eio examples

  The README.md has been updated to point to existing eio example
  project sources.

  Update dependencies to work with 4.14.0+trunk
  
  A series of patches that update the dependencies in Sandmark to
  build 4.14.0+trunk with dune.2.9.0.

* We are continuing to integrate and test building of 4.12.0 OCaml
  variants with Sandmark-2.0 with `current-bench` for both sequential
  and parallel benchmarks.

Our thanks to all the OCaml users, developers and contributors in the
community for their valuable time and support to the project. Stay
safe!
