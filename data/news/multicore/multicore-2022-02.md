Welcome to the February 2022 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) monthly report! As with [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly), these have been compiled by me, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan.

Progress towards a stable OCaml 5.0.0 release have been moving forward at full steam, with most of the multicore OCaml work now happening directly within the main ocaml/ocaml repository. As a number of [deprecations](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/Changes) have happened in OCaml 5.0+trunk, it can be a little tricky in the immediate term to get a working development environment.  You may find these resources helpful:
- There is a [multicore monorepo](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/awesome-multicore-ocaml-and-multicore-monorepo/9515) which is a 'fast clone and dune build' with a number of ecosystem libraries. (thanks @patricoferris)
- There is an [alpha-opam-repository](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository/tree/master/packages) which contains work-in-progress packages.  If a package you maintain is in there, now would be a good time to start releasing it to the mainline opam-repository.  Remember that while we can propose changes, only the community maintainers of the relevant projects can do the actual release, so **your help with making OCaml 5.0-compatible releases of your projects would be very much appreciated**. (thanks @kit-ty-kate)


For mainline development, the [compiler development newsletter](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-compiler-development-newsletter-issue-5-november-2021-to-february-2022/9459) has an overview of what's been happening in the compiler.  From a multicore perspective:
- the [ARM64 PR](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pulls/10972) has been merged, so your shiny Mac M1s will now work
- we continue to work on the post-Multicore merge tasks for an upcoming 5.0.0+trunk release. The documentation efforts on the OCaml memory model, runtime system, and STW synchronization have also started.
- The [eio project](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio) is actively being developed which now includes UDP support with Eio's networking interface.  There has been [robust discussion](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/effects) on several aspects of eio which is all influencing the next iteration of its design (thank you to everyone!). For those of you who do not wish to participate in public discussion, feel free to get in touch with me or @kayceesrk for a private discussion, particularly if you have a large OCaml codebase and opinions on concurrency. We'll summarise all these discussions as best we can over the coming months.
-  `Sandmark-nightly` and `Sandmark` have a custom variant support feature to build trunk, developer branches, or a specific commit to assess any performance regressions. The backend tooling with UI enhancements continue to drive the `current-bench` project forward.

As always, the Multicore OCaml updates are listed first, which are then followed by the ecosystem tooling updates. Finally, the sandmark, sandmark-nightly and current-bench project tasks are mentioned for your reference.
