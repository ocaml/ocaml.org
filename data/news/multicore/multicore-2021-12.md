title: OCaml Multicore - December 2021 and the Big PR
description: Monthly update from the OCaml Multicore team.
date: "2021-12-01"
tags: [multicore]
---

Welcome to the December 2021 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) monthly report! The [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) along with this update have been compiled by myself, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan.

Well, it's finally here! @kayceesrk opened the [Multicore OCaml PR#10831](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10831) to the main OCaml development repository that represents the "minimum viable" implementation of multicore OCaml that we decided on in [November's core team review](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-ocaml-november-2021-with-results-of-code-review/8934#core-team-code-review-1).  The branch pushes the limits of GitHub's rendering capability, with around 4000 commits.

Once the PR was opened just before Christmas, the remaining effort has been for a number of developers to pore over [the diff](http://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10831.diff) and look for any unexpected changes that crept in during multicore development. A large number of code changes, improvements and fixes have been merged into the ocaml-multicore trees since the PR was opened to facilitate this upstreaming process. We're expecting to have the PR merged during January, and then will continue onto the "post-MVP" tasks described last month, but working directly from ocaml/ocaml from now on.  We therefore remain on track to release OCaml 5.00 in 2022.

In the multicore ecosystem, progress also continued:
- `Eio` continues to improve as the recommended effects-based direct-style IO library to
use with Multicore OCaml.
- A newer `domainslib.0.4.0` has been released that includes bug fixes and API changes.
- The continuous benchmarking pipeline with further integration enhancements between Sandmark and current-bench is making progress.

We would like to acknowledge the following external contributors as well::

* Danny Willems (@dannywillems) for an OCaml implementation of the Pippenger benchmark and reporting an undefined behaviour.
* Matt Pallissard (@mattpallissard) reported an installation issue with `Eio` with vendored uring.
* Edwin Torok (@edwintorok) for contributing a PR to `domainslib` to allow use of a per-channel key.

As always, the Multicore OCaml updates are listed first, which contain the upstream efforts, improvements, fixes, test suite, and documentation changes. This is followed by the ecosystem updates to `Eio`, `Tezos`, and `Domainslib`. The Sandmark, sandmark-nightly and current-bench tasks are finally listed for your reference.

  The implementation for a "proper" PRNG+Domains semantics where
  spawning a domain "splits" the PRNG state is under review.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#791](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/791)
  `caml_process_pending_actions_exn` is missing
  
  The `caml_process_pending_actions_exn` returns exceptions as an
  OCaml value instead of raising them, and the C API call is missing
  on Multicore OCaml.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#795](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/795)
  Make `Minor_heap_max` and `Max_domains` as `OCAMLRUNPARAM` options
  
  The `Minor_heap_max` is defined as 2GB and `Max_domains` as 128 in
  `runtime/caml/config.h`, and there is an out of memory issue on
  Multicore OCaml when running tools like AFL and Valgrind. The
  suggestion is to make these parameters as `OCAMLRUNPARAM` options.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#799](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/799)
  Bring `runner.sh` in the CI in line with trunk
  
  The `runner.sh` script in `ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore` has
  changed and diverged from trunk. It needs to be updated to be in
  sync with `ocaml/ocaml`.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#806](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/806)
  Unify GC interrupt and signal triggering mechanisms
  
  The interaction between signal and GC interrupts need to be
  reworked, as they exist as two independent mechanisms.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#811](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/811)
  Double check rebase through `ocaml/ocaml`
  
  An ongoing review of the porting of Multicore OCaml signal handling
  changes for x86, ARM, PPC and s390x architectures.

* A new
  [ocaml-multicore/ocaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml)
  project repository has been created from `ocaml/ocaml` to keep it in
  sync with trunk.

#### Improvements

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#765](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/765)
  `tools/gdb_ocamlrun.py` needs an update
  
  The `tools/gdb_ocamlrun.py` has hardcoded values, and both
  `Forcing_tag` and `Cont_tag` need to be updated.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#772](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/772)
  Not all registers need to be saved for `caml_call_realloc_stack`
  
  The C callee saved registers are saved by `caml_try_realloc_stack`
  and they do not invoke the GC. There is no need to save all the
  registers in `caml_call_realloc_stack`.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#775](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/775)
  Use explicit next pointer in `gc_regs_bucket`
  
  In `amd64.S`, the last word of a `gc_regs_bucket` contains either a
  saved value of `rax` or a pointer to a previous structure. The
  suggestion is to use distinct members for these two entities.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#793](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/793)
  Ring buffer-based runtime tracing (`eventring`)
  
  `Eventring` is a low-overhead runtime tracing system for continuous
  monitoring of OCaml applications. It is a replacement for the
  existing eventlog system present in the runtime, and uses per-domain
  memory-mapped ring buffers. The JSON output of
  `OCAML_EVENTRING_START=1 _build/default/src/traceevents_lib.exe` on
  Chrome's tracing viewer is shown below:

  ![OCaml-Multicore-PR-793-Chrome|690x149](https://discuss.ocaml.org/uploads/short-url/RykCGqsYr4FjqCEod45QdKNwV9.png)

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#794](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/794)
  Audit `OCAMLRUNPARAM` options
  
  A number of `OCAMLRUNPARAM` options, such as `init_heap_wsz` and
  `init_heap_chunk_sz`, can be removed as they are not used.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#796](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/796)
  `Caml_state` for domains should not use mmap
  
  The `Caml_state` is no longer located adjacent to the minor heap
  area, whose allocation is done using mmap. At present, a dedicated
  register (`r14` on amd64) is used to point to `Caml_state`. The use
  of `malloc` at the domain creation time is sufficient to simplify
  and manage `Caml_state`.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#805](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/805)
  Improve `stack_size_bucket`/`alloc_stack_noexc`
  
  The current stack cache scheme will not use caching when
  `stack_size_bucket`/`alloc_stack_noexc` is not a power of two. The
  new stacks begin at `caml_fiber_wsz` and increase by a factor of
  two. There is room for refactoring and improving this code.

  Stdlib: simplify `is_main_domain`
  
  The `is_main_domain` implementation is made simpler in
  `stdlib/domain.ml`, and the PR also removes the
  `caml_ml_domain_is_main_domain` primitive.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#803](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/803)
  Remove difference in stack resize with debug runtime
  
  The difference in the stack resizing between the standard and debug
  runtimes has been removed, in order to help reproduce any bug
  experienced in the standard runtime with the same stack resize in
  the debug runtime.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#804](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/804)
  Remove redundant opens
  
  The redundant `open` calls in
  `testsuite/tests/weak-ephe-final/ephetest_par.ml` have been removed.
  
* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#820](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/820)
  Minor improvements
  
  The use of `memmove` in `runtime/sys.c` has been replaced with
  `memcpy`, and the code has been cleaned up in both
  `runtime/callback.c` and `runtime/caml/callback.h`.

#### Fixes

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#725](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/725)
  Blocked signal infinite loop fix

  A monotonic `recorded_signals_counter` was added to fix the possible
  loop in `caml_enter_blocking_section` when no domain can handle a
  blocked signal. The consensus now is to move from counting signals
  to coalescing them, and hence this requires a code rewrite.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#749](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/749)
  Potential bug on `Forward_tag` short-circuiting?
  
  Short-circuiting is disabled on values of type `Forward_tag`,
  `Lazy_tag` and `Double_tag` in the minor GC, and the bug that occurs
  when short-circuiting `Forward_tag` on values of type
  `Obj.forcing_tag` has been fixed.

  Address feedback on GC from async review
  
  A comment has been added to `runtime/finalise.c` for
  `coaml_final_merge_finalisable` on why the young of the source are
  added to the old of the target. The cap computed work limit is set
  to 0.3, as you cannot do more than 1/3 of a GC cycle in one slice.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#800](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/800)
  Document which GC stats are global and which are per-domain

  Use a lock-free run queue for luv backend
  
  The PR removes the need for a mutex around the queue, and there is a
  trivial improvement in the single-domain benchmark:
  
  Before:
  ```
  $ make bench EIO_BACKEND=luv

  After:
  ```
  $ make bench EIO_BACKEND=luv

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#103](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/103)
  Add `Domain_manager.run` to start a domain with an event loop
  
  The `lib_eio/eio.ml` code has added `Domain_manager.run` and
  `Domain_manager.run_raw` functions. The `Domain_manager.run`
  function must only access thread-safe values from the calling
  domain.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#104](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/104)
  Split out `Ctf_unix` module
  
  The dependency on `Unix` has been removed from the `Eio` module, and
  the `Ctf_unix.with_tracing` function has been added for convenience.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#106](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/106)
  Avoid `Fun.protect` in `Eio_linux.run`
  
  The use of `Fun.protect` is removed from
  `lib_eio_linux/eio_linux.ml` as it throws an exception, which is not
  useful when the scheduler crashes.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#107](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/107)
  Make cancellation thread-safe
  
  A cancellation context now has a list of fibres, and when a fibre is
  forked, it gets added to a list. As soon as the fibre finishes, it
  is removed from the list. The list is only accessible from the
  fibre's own domain, and each fibre holds a single, optionally atomic
  cancellation function.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#108](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/108)
  Clean up Waiters API
  
  The result type was not required by many users and has thus been
  removed. The relevant documentation has been updated as well.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#109](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/109)
  Use lock-free run queue in `eio_linux` tools
  
  The `lib_eio_linux/eio_linux.ml` file has been updated to use a
  lock-free run queue. The results on a single core benchmark are
  shown below:
  
  ```
  $ dune exec -- ./bench/bench_yield.exe`
  ```

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#110](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/110)
  Make `Waiters.wake_one` safe with cancellation
  
  As `wake_one` was being called after a cancelled waiter, we could
  not wake anything when using multiple domains. This PR fixes the
  same in `lib_eio/waiters.ml` along with a stress test.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#111](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/111)
  Restore domains test
  
  The `tests/tests_domains.md` file has now been enabled, since a fix
  to Multicore OCaml was backported to 4.12+domains. The tests also
  now run in the CI.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#112](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/112)
  Add `Stream.take_nonblocking`
  
  The `lib_eio/stream.ml` file has been updated to include a
  `Stream.take_nonblocking` function along with a couple of tests.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#113](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/113)
  Explain about `Promises` and `Streams` in the README
  
  The README has been updated with a section each on `Promises` and
  `Streams`, and the `Fibre.fork` code and tests have been simplified.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#114](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/114)
  Allow `Domain_mgr.run` to be cancelled
  
  The run() function in `lib_eio/eio.ml` has been updated to inject a
  cancel exception into the spawned domain. The tests for cancelling
  another domain, and spawning when already cancelled have been added
  to `tests/test_domains.md`.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#115](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/115)
  Create fibre context before forking
  
  A fibre is created without being started immediately, which allows
  more flexibility in scheduling and reduces the number of contexts.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#117](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/117)
  Allow to set `SO_REUSEPORT` option
  
  The PR adds support to set the `SO_REUSEPORT` socket setting for the
  `linux_uring` backend.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#118](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/118)
  Improve scheduling of forks
  
  The old `Fork` effect has been implemented similar to `Fork_ignore`,
  and `Fork_ignore` has been renamed to `Fork`. The old `Fiber.fork`
  is now `Fibre.fork_promise`. When forking, the caller is scheduled
  at the head of the run-queue, as this new scheduling order is more
  natural, flexible and better for caching.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#119](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/119)
  Improve cancellation
  
  The `Fibre.check` function has been added to check whether the
  current context has been cancelled, and documentation on
  cancellation has been updated.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#121](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/121)
  Add rationales for end-of-life and dynamic dispatch

#### Domainslib

* [ocaml-multicore/domainslib#50](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/50)
  Multi_channel: allow more than one instance per program with different configurations
  
  A shared global state in `Multi_channel` exists in the form of
  `dls_new_key` that results in out-of-bounds array indexing. This PR,
  contributed by Edwin Torok (@edwintorok), removes the global key,
  and uses a per-channel key.

* [ocaml-multicore/domainslib#60](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/60)
  Bug fix in `parallel_scan`
  
  The final entry in the array result was incorrect for
  `~num_additional_domains:1`, and for the case of rejecting an input
  array size less than the pool size.
  
* A new
  [domainslib.0.4.0](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/releases/tag/0.4.0)
  has been released that includes a breaking change. We now need to
  use effect handlers for task creation, and all computations need to
  be enclosed in a `Task.run` function.

   Added package remove feature and builds for 5.00
   
   The `main` branch now supports a `package remove` option for the
   OCaml variants, where you can dynamically de-select the dependency
   package that you do not wish to build. For example, in
   `ocaml-versions/5.00.0+trunk.json`, you can specify the following:
   
   ```json
   {
      "url" : "https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/trunk.tar.gz",
      "package_remove": [
        "index",
        "integers",

  Workers: run one benchmark per CPU
  
  You can now run multiple benchmarks in parallel, each using its own
  CPU with the following setting in the `.env` file:
  
  ```
  OCAML_BENCH_DOCKER_CPU=4,5,6
  ```

  Make the Debian version more explicit
  
  The `pipeline/Dockerfile` and `pipeline/Dockerfile.env` files have
  been updated to be explicit on the Debian image
  `ocaml/opam:debian-11-ocaml-4.13` to be used.

* [ocurrent/current-bench#254](https://github.com/ocurrent/current-bench/pull/254)

  Config repositories to run with specific workers and OCaml versions
  
  A static configuration can be provided to current-bench that
  specifies which workers and OCaml versions to use with the
  benchmarks. This is useful to obtain deterministic results for
  Sandmark workers that are Multicore enabled. For example:
  
  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "author/repo",
      "worker": "autumn",
      "image": "ocaml/opam"
    },
    {
      "name": "local/local",
      "image": "ocaml/opam:debian-ocaml-4.11"
    }
  ]
  ```

Our special thanks to all the OCaml users, developers and contributors in the community for their valuable time and continued support to the project. Stay safe and happy new year!
