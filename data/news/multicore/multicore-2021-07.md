Welcome to the July 2021 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) monthly report! This month's update along with the [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) has been compiled by me, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan. As August is usually a period of downtime in Europe, the next update may be merged with the September one in a couple of months (but given our geographically diverse nature now, if enough progress happens in August I'll do an update).

The overall status of the multicore efforts are right on track: our contributions to the next OCaml release have been [incorporated in 4.13.0~alpha2](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-4-13-0-second-alpha-release/8164), and our focus remains on crushing incompatibilities and bugs to generate domains-only parallelism patches suitable for upstream review and release.  As a lower priority activity, we continue to develop the experimental "effects-based" IO stack, which will feature in the upcoming virtual OCaml Workshop at ICFP in August 2021.

The `4.12.0+domains` trees continue to see a tail of bugs being steadily fixed. After last month's call, we saw a number of external contributors step up to submit fixes in addition to the multicore and core OCaml teams. We would like to acknowledge and thank them!

* @emillon (Etienne Millon) for running the Jane Street `core` v0.14 test suite with 4.12.0+domains and sharing the test results (and finding a [multicore GC edge case bug](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/624) while at it).
* @Termina1 (Vyacheslav Shebanov) for testing the compilation of `batteries` 3.30 with Multicore OCaml 4.12.0+domains.
* @nbecker (Nils Becker) for reporting on `parallel_map` and `parallel_scan` for domainslib.
* Filip Koprivec for identifying a memory leak when using `flush_all` with `ocamlc` with 4.12.0+domains.

All of these fixes, combined with some big-ticket compatibility changes (listed below) are getting me pretty close to using 4.12.0+domains as my daily OCaml opam switch of choice. I encourage you to also give it a try and report (good or bad) results on [the multicore OCaml tracker](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues).  If these sorts of problems grab your attention, then [Segfault Systems is hiring in India](https://segfault.systems/careers.html) to work with @kayceesrk and the team there on multicore OCaml.

For benchmarking, the Jupyter notebooks for the Sandmark nightly benchmark runs have  been updated, and we continue to test the Sandmark builds for the  4.12+ variants and 4.14.0+trunk. Progress has been made to integrate  `current-bench` OCurrent pipeline with the Sandmark 2.0 -alpha branch  changes to reproduce the current Sandmark functionality, which will allow GitHub PRs to be benchmarked systematically before being merged.

As always, the Multicore OCaml ongoing and completed tasks are listed first, which are then followed by the updates from the Ecosystem libraries. The Sandmark nightly build efforts, benchmarking updates and relevant current-bench tasks are then mentioned. Finally, the update on the upstream OCaml Safepoints PR is provided for your reference.
