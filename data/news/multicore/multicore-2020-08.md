Welcome to the August 2020 Multicore OCaml report (a few weeks late due to August slowdown). This update along with the [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) have been compiled by @shakthimaan, @kayceesrk and myself.

There are some talks related to multicore OCaml which are now freely available online:

- At the OCaml Workshop, @sadiq presented ["How to parallelise your code with Multicore OCaml"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7YZR1q8wzI&list=PLKO_ZowsIOu5fHjRj0ua7_QWE_L789K_f&index=6&t=0s)
- At ICFP, @kayceesrk presented ["Retrofitting Parallelism onto OCaml"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9wgeX7e-nc&t=6180s), which was also awarded a Distinguished Paper award.
- At ICFP, Glenn MÃ©vel presented ["Cosmo: A Concurrent Separation Logic for Multicore OCaml"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNLOi-1ixwM&t=2610s).
- At the WebAssembly Community Group meeting,  @kayceesrk gave a talk on [Effect Handlers in Multicore OCaml](https://kcsrk.info/slides/WASM_CG_4Aug20.pdf).  This is related to our longer term efforts to ensure that OCaml has an efficient compilation strategy to WebAssembly.

The Multicore OCaml project has had a number of optimisations and performance improvements in the month of August 2020:
- The PR on the [implementation of systhreads with pthreads](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/381) continues to undergo review and improvement. When merged, this opens up the possibility of installing dune and other packages with Multicore OCaml.
- Implementations of mutex and condition variables is also now [under review](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/390) for the `Domain` module.
- Work has begun on implementing [GC safe points](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/394) to ensure reliable, low-latency garbage collection can occur.

We would like to particularly thank these external contributors:
* Albin Coquereau and Guillaume Bury for their comments and recommendations on building Alt-Ergo.2.3.2 with dune.2.6.0 and Multicore OCaml 4.10.0 in a sandbox environment.
* @Leonidas for testing the code size metric implementation with `Core` and `Async`, and for code review changes.

Contributions such as the above towards adapting your projects with our benchmarking suites are always most welcome.  As with previous updates, we begin with the Multicore OCaml updates, which are then followed by the enchancements and bug fixes to the Sandmark benchmarking project. The upstream OCaml ongoing and completed tasks are finally mentioned for your reference.

## Multicore OCaml

### Ongoing

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#381](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/381)
  Reimplementating systhreads with pthreads

  This PR has made tremendous progress with additions to domain API,
  changes in interaction with the backup thread, and bug fixes. We are
  now able to build `dune.2.6.1` and `utop` with this PR for Multicore
  OCaml, and it is ready for review!

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#384](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/384)
  Add a primitive to insert nop instruction

  The `nop` primitive is introduced to identify the start and end of
  an instruction sequence to aid in debugging low-level code.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#390](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/390)
  Initial implementation of Mutexes and Condition Variables

  A draft proposal that adds support for Mutex variables and Condition
  operations for the Multicore runtime.

### Completed

#### Optimisations

* [ocaml-multicore/domainslib#16](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/16)
  Improvement of parallel_for implementation

  A divide-and-conquer scheme is introduced to distribute work in
  `parallel_for`, and the `chunk_size` is made a parameter to improve
  scaling with more than 8-16 cores. The blue line in the following
  illustration shows the improvement for few benchmarks in Sandmark
  using the default `chunk_size` along with this PR:
 ![OCaml-Domainslib-16-Illustration|465x500](https://discuss.ocaml.org/uploads/short-url/u4M9bCyA5fu77JZRyJZv4KxMjj3.png) 

* [ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam/pull/28)
  Use `-j%{jobs}%` for multicore variant builds

  The use of `-j%{jobs}%` in the build step for multicore variants
  will speed up opam installs.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#374](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/374)
  Force major slice on minor collection

  A minor collection will need to schedule a major collection, if a
  blocked thread may not progress the major GC when servicing the
  minor collector through `handle_interrupt`.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#378](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/378)
  Hold onto empty pools if swept while allocating

  An optimization to improve pause times and reduce the number of
  locks by using a `release_to_global_pool` flag in `pool_sweep`
  function that continues to hold onto the empty pools.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#379](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/379)
  Interruptible mark and sweep

  The mark and sweep work is now made interruptible so that domains
  can enter the stop-the-world minor collections even if one domain is
  performing a large task. For example, for the binary tree benchmark
  with four domains, major work (pink) in domain three stalls progress
  for other domains as observed in the eventlog.

  With this patch, we can observe that the major work in domains two
  and four make progress in the following illustration:

  Make DLS call to `caml_domain_dls_get` `@@noalloc`

  The `caml_dls_get` is tagged with `@@noalloc` to reduce the C call
  overhead.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#382](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/382)
  Optimise `caml_continuation_use_function`

  A couple of optimisations that yield 25% performance improvements
  for the generator example by using `caml_domain_alone`, and using
  `caml_gc_log` under `DEBUG` mode.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#389](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/389)
  Avoid holding domain_lock when using backup thread

  The wait time for the main OCaml thread is reduced by altering the
  backup thread logic without holding the `domain_lock` for the
  `BT_IN_BLOCKING_SECTION`.

#### Sundries

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#391](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/391)
  Use `Word_val` for pointers with `Patomic_load`

  A bug fix to correctly handle `Patomic_load` for loaded pointers.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#392](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/392)
  Include Ipoll in leaf function test

  The `Ipoll` operation is now added to `asmcomp/amd64/emit.mlp` as an external call.

## Benchmarking
