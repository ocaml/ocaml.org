Welcome to the January 2022 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) monthly update! This update along with the [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) has been compiled by @avsm, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan.

@xavierleroy clicked "merge" on the [upstream Multicore OCaml PR#10831](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10831#issuecomment-1008935795) to upstream OCaml, which simultaneously made for a great start to the new year and prepared us for the hard work ahead to get to a stable release of OCaml 5.00.0! Since the merge, we have continued to work on the release via bug fixes, code improvements, and tooling support directly in the main ocaml repository. Notably, a new draft PR for [ARM64 backend support](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10972) has already been proposed.

OCaml 5.0 trunk also [removes a number of deprecated modules](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/3e622e41aca318df0d8ccfeb5c65272a0d2acfa3/Changes#L47-L66), and renames `EffectHandlers` to `Effect` for consistency with the rest of the standard library. In the ecosystem, several of the key support libraries like `uring`, `multicore-opam`, and `domainslib` have had updates to work with 5.0.0+trunk. The Eio effects-based direct-style parallel IO for OCaml has had significant enhancements, and now also builds with OCaml 5.00.0+trunk. The Sandmark benchmarking suite now provides a `5.00.0+stable` and `5.00.0+trunk` OCaml variants to build the benchmarks for trunk.

# OCaml 5.00 Release Planning

The core development team is currently pinning down exactly what will constitute the OCaml 5.00 release in terms of supported features. Anything that will be part of OCaml 5.00 but not currently supported must be in this list so that we can plan for its implementation.  If you spot something that isn't below but should be, please get in touch or post a reply.  This list is, as always, subject to change as the core development team plans and implements the release.

## Runtime

* Mark stack overflow
  + Currently the mark-stack is allowed to grow to an unbounded size. There is a multicore implementation of mark stack overflow in [mc#466](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/466) .
This design is complex and concurrently touches the major GC logic for determining when marking is complete. There is a feeling that a better design is to handle mark stack overflow with a stop-the-world section, but this has not yet been tried. 
* Statmemprof
* Make the runtime memory model safe
  + Ensure that the implementation of `caml_modify` is correct.
  + Fix warnings reported by Thread Sanitizer on the testsuite.
* Mark pre-fetching optimisation
* Minor heap design that reduces virtual memory consumption
  + [#10955](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10955) proposes deciding size of the minor area at program startup rather than fixed 256GB reservation now. Fixes Valgrind and AFL (with default limited virtual memory).
  + Designs exploring alternative organisation of minor heap (DLAB, BiBoP) is 
    1. Too risky to undertake now due to code change
    2. Benefits unclear. See experiments in [mc#508](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/508).
* Make runtime safe for async callbacks
  + See the meta issue on asynchronous callback handling in [#10915](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10915)
  + Potentially requires changes to both the stop-the-world mechanism and major GC logic
  + Currently no proposed plan or implementation. Implementation will require significant testing and benchmarking
  + May make sense to complete as part of statmemprof work as both will potentially encounter similar implementation issues
* Eventring runtime tracing eventlog replacement
  + Monitoring and optimising GC in multicore programs is difficult, current multicore eventlog was a temporary fix
  + PR that adds eventring support to trunk in [#10964](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10964)
* Runtime is capable of running bytecode-only for 32-bit platforms?
  + sequential or multiple domains?
* Remove the use of mmap for `Caml_state`  (see [mc#796](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/796))

## Stdlib

* Finish the Stdlib audit ([#10960](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10960))
* Domains, Mutex, Semaphore, Condition in 4.14
  + Support systhread based implementation of Domains and related modules. Mutex, Semaphore and Condition work as is. 
  + 4.14 is pretty much frozen already; so an emulation of Domains can be provided by a separate compatibility library.
* API Docs
  + Write API docs for effect handlers and domains
* Manual chapters
  + New manual chapters for effect handlers, domains and memory model
* OCamldoc thread-safety annotations
  + Introduce an OCamldoc tag for thread-safety ([#10983](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10983)).
  + Partial order between `domain-safe`, `systhread-safe`, `fiber-safe`. `not-concurrency-safe` as default placeholder for those API functions, modules not audited for thread-safety.
* Atomic arrays 
* Atomic mutable record fields
* Concurrency-safe lazy
  + Lazy that is safe for domains, systhreads and fibers


## Backend / middle-end

* Flambda support
* Arm64 support
  + Currently being worked on in trunk.
  + Targets are Mac M1 and AWS Graviton
* 32-bit support (
  + Sequential-only native backend is achievable on x86.  32-bit ARM can probably support multiple domains.  Time to drop x86-32 to bytecode only?
  + Wasm is 32-bit only now.
* RISC-V, Power, ...
* OpenBSD, FreeBSD merged.
  + [#10875](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10875) adds OpenBSD support
* MSVC support on Windows.
* Framepointer support
  + Useful for `perf` based performance benchmarking.
  + x86 and/or arm64?

## Tooling

## Multicore OCaml

### Ongoing

#### Discussion

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#750](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/750)
  Discussing the design of Lazy under Multicore
  
  A design discussion of Lazy under Multicore OCaml that involves
  sequential Lazy, concurrency problems, duplicated computations, and
  memory safety.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#795](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/795)
  Make `Minor_heap_max` and `Max_domains` as `OCAMLRUNPARAM` options
  
  The `Minor_heap_max` is defined as 2GB and `Max_domains` as 128 in
  `runtime/caml/config.h`, and there is an OOM issue on Multicore
  OCaml when running tools like AFL and Valgrind. The `OCAMLRUNPARAM`
  option can be used to pass these parameters as arguments. An
  upstream discussion has been initiated for the same at
  [ocaml/ocaml#10971](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10971).

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#806](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/806)
  Unify GC interrupt and signal triggering mechanisms
  
  The interaction between signal and GC interrupts need to be
  reworked, as they exist as two independent mechanisms. There has
  been progress on asynchronous actions in trunk in parallel with the
  Multicore implementation.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10861](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10861)
  Outstanding comments in the OCaml Multicore PR
  
  A tracker issue to record and document outstanding comments in the
  Multicore PR for the 5.00 milestone.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10915](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10915)
  Meta-issue on asynchronous action handling in Multicore
  
  A discussion on unifying GC interrupt and signal triggering
  mechanisms and review comments from Multicore OCaml PR#10831.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10930](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10930)
  Downstream patch changes for removed `Stream` and `Pervasives` library PR#10896
  
  A review of the recommended patch changes for Sandmark dependencies
  used to run parallel benchmarks for 5.00.0+trunk.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10960](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10960)
  Audit `stdlib` for mutable state
  
  The OCaml 5.00 stdlib implementation should be both memory and
  thread-safe, and this issue tracker has been created to audit stdlib
  for mutable state.

#### Upstream

* [ocaml/ocaml#10876](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10876)
  Make Format buffer more efficient to Multicore
  
  The Format buffer implementation needs to be made more efficient. In
  particular, when a second domain is spawned, Format switches to a
  buffered implementation for stdout/stderr where the writes only
  happen on flushes.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10953](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10953)
  `ocamltest/summarize.awk` not properly reporting abort failures on testsuite runs
  
  The `summarize.awk` and `ocamltest` can skip reporting failures if
  the log is improperly formatted, and this needs to be addressed.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10971](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10971)
  Means of limiting how much memory is being reserved by the runtime,
  so that Valgrind and AFL can be used
  
  The amount of virtual memory to be reserved in the OCaml runtime can
  be limited and this needs to be made a runtime parameter.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10974](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10974)
  `domain.c`: Use an atomic counter for domain unique IDs
  
  The dependency on a fixed `Max_domains` setting needs to be removed
  to dynamically configure the same during program execution.

#### Improvements

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#796](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/796)
  `Caml_state` for domains should not use mmap
  
  The `Caml_state` is no longer located adjacent to the minor heap
  area whose allocation is done using mmap. A PR for the same is
  actively being worked upon.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10908](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10908)
  Fix possible race in `caml_mem_map` on Windows
  
  The `runtime/platform.c` has been updated to fix a possible race
  condition in `caml_mem_map`, and debugging printf statements have
  been removed.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10925](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10925)
  Rename symbol for `Caml_state` to `caml_state`
  
  `Caml_state` is a macro in Mac OS, and hence the same has been
  renamed to `caml_state` to avoid a name collision.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10950](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10950)
  Allocate domain state using `malloc` instead of `mmap`
  
  The PR replaces the unnecessary use of `mmap` with `malloc` to
  simplify `Caml_state` management.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10965](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10965)
  Thread safety for all runtime hooks
  
  The PR implements the thread-safety of hooks and restores the GC
  timing hooks in Multicore.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10966](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10966)
  Simplifications/cleanups/clarifications for Multicore review
  
  The APIs for signals/actions have been simplified, `caml_modify` has
  been documented, and dead code has been removed.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10969](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10969)
  Switch to `strerror_t` for reentrant error string conversion
  
  The PR uses `strerror_t` for string conversion as `strerror` in the
  runtime is not reentrant in the presence of multiple threads.

#### ARM64

* [ocaml/ocaml#10943](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10943)
  Introduce atomic loads in Cmm and Mach IRs
  
  The `Patomic_load` primitive needs to be enhanced to ease support
  for other architectures. This is required for the ARM64 support.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10972](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10972)
  ARM64 Multicore Support
  
  A draft PR that implements the assembler, proc and emit changes
  needed to get ARM64 working has been proposed. The changes have been
  tested on MacOS/M1 and a Linux/Graviton2.

#### Metrics

* [ocaml/ocaml#10961](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10961)
  Handle orphaning of GC statistics
  
  The allocation of `domain_state` to use `malloc` in Multicore
  implementation prevents freeing `Caml_state` at domain termination,
  and this issue needs to be addressed.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10964](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10964)
  Ring-buffer based runtime tracing (`eventring`)
  
  Eventring is a runtime tracing system designed for continuous
  monitoring of OCaml applications. The following illustration shows
  how eventring can be used to log the runtime data using Chrome's
  trace viewer.

#### Improvements

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#830](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/830)
  Remove `Int/Long/Bool_field` macros
  
  The `Long_val(Field())` usage alone is now sufficient as the `Int`,
  `Long` and `Bool_field` macros are no longer needed.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#831](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/831)

* [ocaml/ocaml#10880](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10880)
  Use a bit-vector to record pending signals
  
  The PR uses an array of bits instead of an array of `NSIG` atomic
  0-or-1 integers to store the presence of pending signals. The

* [ocaml/ocaml#10887](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10887)
  Generalize the `Domain.DLS` interface to split PRNG state for child domains
  
  The PR implements a "proper" PRNG+Domains semantics for the case
  when spawning a domain splits the PRNG state.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10935](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10935)
  Reimplement `Thread.exit` using an exception
  
  The PR reimplements `Thread.exit` by simply raising a dedicated
  `Thread.Exit` exception for better resource management, instead of
  stopping the current thread.

#### Fixes

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#823](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/823)
  Minor fixes
  
  Additional fixes in `runtime/`, `middle_end` and `otherlibs` code to
  be more aligned with trunk.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#828](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/828)
  Initialise `extern_flags` to 0 on extern stat init
  
  The `extern_flags` need to be initialised to zero. Otherwise, its
  subsequent use in `reachable_words` returns junk values resulting in
  memory corruption.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#829](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/829)
  Fix pthread name setting on FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD
  
  The portability changes for `pthread` naming in order to build for
  FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10853](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10853)
  Fix a crash in `Obj.reachable_words`
  
  A segmentation fault in `Obj.reachable_words` has been fixed in this
  PR. A marshaling operation can leave the `extern_flags` with the
  `NO_SHARING` bit set, and hence the same is now initialized before
  calling `extern_init_position_table`.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10873](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10873)
  Fixup `Filename.check_suffix`; remove duplicate `,` fix for OCAMLRUNPARAM
  
  The PR includes the `caml_parse_ocamlrunparam` duplicate fix for
  empty `,` in OCAMLRUNPARAM, and an update to `Filename.check_suffix`
  from the review of Multicore OCaml PR#10831.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10881](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10881)
  Fix build for `mingw-w64` on Jenkins
  
  The `winpthread-1.dll` file is required as it sets the desired PATH
  for the builds.

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#832](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/832)
  Fix reachable words, part deux
  
  The `Obj.reachable_words` has been updated to not cause a
  segmentation fault. Also, the changes have been synchronised with
  the 4.14 branch.

#### Testing

* [ocaml/ocaml#10888](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10888)
  Re-enable `afl-instrumentation` test, run without a virtual memory limit
  
  The `afl-fuzz` test program, run as a child process, requires more
  than 50MB of virtual memory for multicore. Hence, a fix is provided
  to remove the memory limit, and the `afl-instrumentation` tests for
  OCaml 5.00.0+trunk have been enabled.

* [ocaml/ocaml#10918](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10918)
  Add an explicit afl-fuzz test
  
  An `afl-fuzz` test without an timeout, and based on the
  readline-example in the manual has been added.

#### Cleanup

* [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#835](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/835)
  Remove `get_bucket`, `get_credit` and `huge_fallback_count`
  
  The `get_bucket`, `get_credit` and `huge_fallback_count` functions
  have been removed from `stdlib`.

## Ecosystem

### Ongoing

#### Eio

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#124](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/124)
  Decide how to represent pathnames
  
  The paths in Eio are strings, but, we need to think on how to
  provide support for Windows paths.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#125](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/125)
  Test on Windows
  
  Eio needs to be supported on Windows, and a CI must be setup for
  this environment.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#126](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/126)
  API for spawning sub-processes
  
  A mechanism to create and manage sub-processes, similar to
  `Lwt_process` is required in `Eio`. This must work using multiple
  domains, allow passing pipes, check or report the process's exit
  status etc.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#138](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/138)
  Integrate Eio's CTF tracing with OCaml's tracing
  
  The proposed `eventring` to replace the OCaml CTF-based `eventlog`
  system can allow users to add custom events that need to be stored.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#140](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/140)
  Decide on `cstruct` vs `bytes`
  
  The IO operations with the kernel require that the GC does not move
  the address of a buffer, which can be implemented using
  `Cstruct.t`. If OCaml 5.00 guarantees that regular strings are not
  moved, then using `bytes` can be an option. Performance measurements
  to compare `cstruct` and `bytes` need to be performed.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#146](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/146)
  `lib_eio`: Add `take_all` function
  
  The `take_all` function has been added to `lib_eio/stream.ml`.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#155](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/155)
  Add `Eio_unix.FD`
  
  An `FD` module has been added to `lib_eio/unix/eio_unix.ml` to be
  used with the `Luv.0.5.11` asynchronous I/O library.

#### Sundries

* [ocaml-multicore/parallel-programming-in-multicore-ocaml#13](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/parallel-programming-in-multicore-ocaml/issues/13)

  A weekly CI build using GitHub Actions will be useful to detect any
  build failures.

* [ocaml-multicore/tezos#13](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/tezos/pull/23)
  Merge upstream updates
  
  An issue tracker to merge the January 24, 2022 updates to the
  `4.12.0+domains` branch.

* [ocaml-multicore/tezos#24](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/tezos/issues/24)
  Test suite failure
  
  An `Alcotest_engine__Core.Make(P) (M)` error has been reported when
  running the test suite.

* [ocaml-multicore/effects-examples#26](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/effects-examples/pull/26)
  Port to OCaml 5.00
  
  A work-in-progress to port all the Effects examples to run with
  OCaml 5.00, without the dedicated effects syntax.

### Completed

#### Eio

##### Added

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#120](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/120)
  Add `Fibre.fork_on_accept` and `Net.accept`
  
  This PR that updates `fork_on_accept` to use an accept function in a
  new switch, and passes the successful result to a handler function
  in a new fibre has been merged.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#130](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/130)
  Add Luv polling functions
  
  The Luv polling functions wrapped in Eio have been added to
  `lib_eio_luv/eio_luv.ml` for Lwt integration.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#133](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/133)
  Add `Switch.dump` and `Cancel.dump` for debugging
  
  The `Switch.dump` and `Cancel.dump` functions have been added for
  debugging purpose. A sample output is shown below:
  
  ```
  Switch 6 (1 extra fibres):
    on [4]
      cancelling(Failure("Background switch turned off")) []
        cancelling(Failure("Background switch turned off")) []
        on (protected) [7]
  ```

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#135](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/135)

  flag for better integration with APIs.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#139](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/139)
  Add `eio.unix` module for Unix integration
  
  A new `eio.unix` module provides both `await_readable` and
  `await_writable` functions, and allows `Lwt_eio` to work with either
  backends. Eio needs to work on browsers and unikernels, and hence it
  must not depend directly on `Unix`.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#141](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/141)
  `lib_eio`: implement `Stream.is_empty`
  
  A `length` and `is_empty` function have been implemented in
  `lib_eio/stream.ml` sources.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#159](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/159)
  Add `Eio.Buf_read`
  
  The addition of `Buf_read` in Eio provides a low-level API to view
  the internal buffer and to mark bytes as consumed. Also, it now has
  a high-level API to read characters, strings, and multi-line text.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#161](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/161)
  Add more functions to `Buf_read`
  
  The functions `peek_char`, `skip`, `pair`, `map`, `bind`, `*>` and
  `<*` have been added to `lib_eio/buf_read.ml` to match the Angstrom
  API. Additional fuzz testing with crowbar have also been included.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#163](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/163)
  Add `Buf_read.{seq,lines}` and `Dir.{load,save}` convenience functions
  
  A `at_end_of_input` function has been added, and `eof` has been
  renamed to `end_of_input` to match Angstrom API. The
  `Buf.read.{seq,lines}` and `Dir.{load.save}` convenience functions
  have been added to make it easy to load and save files, and to read
  a file line by line.

##### Build

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#128](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/128)
  Depend on `base-domains`
  
  The opam repository now provides a `base-domains` package, which
  will be used instead of hard-coding an explicit dependency on
  `ocaml.4.12.0+domains`.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#137](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/137)
  Rename `eunix` to `eio.utils`
  
  The collection of utility modules for building `Eio` backends have
  been renamed from `enix` to `eio.utils`, as a separate OPAM package
  is not required.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#147](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/147)
  Remove unused `bigstringaf` dependency
  
  The `bigstringaf` dependency is no longer required and the same has
  been removed.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#149](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/149)
  Remove dependency on ppxlib
  
  The `lib_ctf/ctf.ml` file was using ppxlib, and the relevant code
  has been inlined. Hence, the dependency on `ppxlib` has been removed
  to build for 5.00.0.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#151](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/151)
  Add support for OCaml 5.00+trunk
  
  The PR updates `eio` to build for OCaml 5.00.0+trunk and keeps
  compatibility with 4.12+domains.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#157](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/157)
  Remove `Unix` dependency from Eio
  
  The dependency on Unix is removed from Eio in order to use it in a
  unikernel or a browser. The `Eio.Unix_perm.t` replaces
  `Unix.file_perm`, and `Eio.Net.Ipaddr.t` replaces `Unix.inet_addr`.

  curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' <scheme>://<host>/benchmarks/metrics --data-raw '
  {
    "repo_owner": "ocurrent",
    "repo_name": "current-bench",

    "run_at": "2022-01-28 12:42:02+05:30",
    "duration": "12.45",
    "benchmarks": [

            "name": "test-1",
            "metrics": [
              {
                "name": "time", "value": 18, "units": "sec"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "benchmark-2",
        "results": [
          {
            "name": "test-1",
            "metrics": [
              {
                "name": "space", "value": 18, "units": "mb"
