Welcome to the March 2022 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) monthly report! This update along with the [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) have been compiled by me, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan.

We have continued steadily towards making a stable OCaml 5.0 release, as you can see from the long list of fixes later -- thank you for all your contributions! Platform configurations that were formerly supported in the 4.x branches for OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD have now been re-enabled. ARM64 support (for macOS, Linux and the BSDs) is stable in trunk, and ARM CFI integration has been merged as a follow-up to facilitate debugging and profiling. Notably, this also includes [memory model tests for ARMv8 and Power ports](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11004). The Windows mingw64 port is also working again in trunk. 

An [effects tutorial](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11093) has also been contributed to the OCaml manual; feedback continues to be welcome even after it's merged in.  As you experiment with effects, please do continue to post to this forum with questions or comments about your learnings.

The Sandmark benchmark project has added bytecode analysis to address any performance regressions. We have also been working on obtaining measurements for the compilation data points. The current-bench pipeline production deployments has significant UI changes, and now has alert notifications for the benchmark runs.

As always, the Multicore OCaml open and completed tasks are listed first, which are then followed by the ecosystem tooling projects. The Sandmark, sandmark-nightly, and current-bench project updates are finally presented for your reference.

  Reserve only `caml_minor_heap_max_wsz` * `Max_domains` for the minor heap

  The initial minor heap size reservation is `s * Max_domains`, and
  domains can use `Gc.set` to increase their minor heap size beyond
  the reservation. The size of the reservation is always
  `caml_minor_heap_max_wsz` * `Max_domains`.

  "main" script to better handle bytecode-only builds, updates to the
  test suite, configuration tweaks and changes to the runtime system.

  Respect user provided maximum stack space value, and fix debug run of `tmp/stack_space.ml` test

  This PR honors `OCAMLRUNPARAM=1` for the initial stack size, and
  ensures that `tmc/stack_space.ml` applies stack restriction during
  the running stage.

* [ocaml/ocaml#11061](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11061)
  `dumpobj` tool crashes

  A fix for the segmentation fault from `tools/dumpobj` on a bytecode
  program has been merged in
  [PR#11077](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11077).

* [ocaml/ocaml#11076](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11076)
  Adjust stack parameters for bytecode to avoid generating too many calls to `caml_ensure_stack_capacity`

  The stack "safety margin" has been decreased to 6 and the stack
  threshold has been increased to 32. Most bytecode functions use no
  more than 32 - 6 stack slots, and this provides a quick fix for the
  byte code regressions.

* [ocaml/ocaml#11077](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11077)

  Fix segfault in fiber management (issue #11094)

  An integer index into an array of lists is now maintained, instead
  of a pointer to the cache in fiber management. This fixes the
  segmentation fault reported when building parallel benchmarks with
  domainslib in Sandmark.

* [ocaml/ocaml#11141](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11141)
  Fix 32-bit build

  Fix performance regression in systhreads on Windows

  The tick thread calls `caml_thread_yield` on the Windows version of
  `select` which was causing performance regressions. The `Sleep`
  function is used instead and the performance differences are
  noticeable as shown below:
  
  ```
  Test                            before/s     run1/s       run2/s
  lib-threads/sieve               5.36         3.18         2.47
