# Multicore OCaml: May 2020

Welcome to the May 2020 update from the Multicore OCaml team! As with [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly), many thanks to @shakthimaan and @kayceesrk for help assembling this month's roundup.  

A major milestone in May 2020 has been the completion of rebasing of Multicore OCaml all the way from 4.06 to 4.10! The Parallel Minor GC variant that performs stop-the-world parallel minor collection is the [default branch](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/tree/parallel_minor_gc) for the compiler, which means that compatibility with C bindings is now much simpler than with the older minor GC design.

I've received many questions asking if this means that multicore OCaml will "just work" with the opam ecosystem now.  Not quite yet: we estimate that we are now one PR away from this working, which requires that the existing `Threads` module is backported to multicore OCaml to support the older (non-parallel-in-the-runtime but concurrent) uses of threading that existing OCaml supports.  This effort was begun a year ago by @jhw in [#240](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/240) and now rebased and being reviewed by @engil in [#342](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/342). Once that is merged and tested by us on a bunch of packages and bulk builds, we should be good to start using Multicore OCaml with opam. Stay tuned for more on that next month!

The ongoing and completed tasks for the Multicore OCaml are listed first, which are then followed by improvements to the Sandmark benchmarking project. Finally, the status of the contributions to upstream OCaml are mentioned for your reference.  This month has also seen a meeting of the core OCaml runtime developers to assign post-rebasing tasks (such as also porting statmemprof, how to handle non-x86 architectures, Windows support, etc) to ensure a more complete view of the upstreaming tasks ahead.  The task list is long, but steadily decreasing in length.

As to how to contribute currently, there is an incredibly exciting seam of work that has now started on the appropriate programming abstractions to support parallel algorithms in OCaml. See [this thread](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/language-abstractions-and-scheduling-techniques-for-efficient-execution-of-parallel-algorithms-on-multicore-hardware/5822/19) for more on that, and also on the [Domainslib](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib) repository for more low-level examples of traditional parallel algorithms.  In a month or so, we expect that the multicore switch will also be more suitable for use with opam, but don't let that stop you from porting your favourite parallel benchmark to Domainslib today.

  files, the notebook prompts you in the GUI to select different
  commit and compiler variants for analysis. A sample screenshot of
  the UI is shown below:

  ![Sequentials select comparison](https://discuss.ocaml.org/uploads/short-url/guDEKu51Mz8QwUwvVXA0FAqaWsf.png)

  The PR adds error handling, user input validation and the project
  README has also been updated.

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#111](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/111)
  Add parallel initialisation and parallel copy to LU decomposition benchmark
  
  The parallel initialisation is now added to LU decomposition
  numerical benchmark
  (benchmarks/multicore-numerical/LU_decomposition_multicore.ml).

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#113](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/113)

## OCaml

### Ongoing

* [ocaml/ocaml#9541](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9541)
  Add manual page for the instrumented runtime

  A draft manual for the instrumented runtime eventlog tracing has
  been created. Please feel free to review the document and share your
  valuable feedback.
  
* [ocaml/dune#3500](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/3500) 
  Support building executables against OCaml 4.11 instrumented runtime
  
  OCaml 4.11.0 has built-in support for the instrumented runtime, and
  it will be useful to have dune generate instrumented targets.

### Completed

* [ocaml/ocaml#9082](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9082)
  Eventlog tracing system

  The Eventlog tracing proposal for the OCaml runtime that uses the
  Binary Trace Format (CTF) is now merged with upstream OCaml
  (4.11.0).

* [ocaml/ocaml#9534](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9534)
  [RFC] Dynamic check for naked pointers

  An RFC for adding the ability to dynamically identify naked pointers
  in the 4.10.0 compiler.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9573](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9573)
  Reimplement Unix.create_process and related functions without Unix.fork

  The use of process creation functions in the Unix module is not
  suitable for Multicore OCaml, for both behaviour and efficiency. The
  patch provides an implementation that uses `posix_spawn`.

* [ocaml/ocaml#9564](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9564)
  Add a macro for out-of-heap block header

  This PR adds a macro definition to construct a out-of-heap block
  header in runtime/caml/mlvalues.h. The objective is to use the
  header for out of heap objects.

As always, we would like to thank all the OCaml developers and users for their continued support and contribution to the project. Stay safe out there.
