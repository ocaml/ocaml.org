Welcome to the June 2021 [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore) monthly report! This month's update along with the [previous update's](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) have been compiled by @avsm, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan.

Our overall goal remains on track for generating a preview tree for OCaml 5.0 multicore domains-only parallelism over the summer.

## Ecosystem compatibility for 4.12.0+domains

In [May's update](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-ocaml-may-2021/7990#ecosystem-changes-to-prepare-for-500-domains-only-2), I noted that our focus was now on adapting the ecosystem to work well with multicore, and I'm pleased to report that this is progressing very well.

- The 4.12.0+domains multicore compiler variant has been [merged into mainline opam-repo](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/18960), so you can now `opam switch 4.12.0+domains` directly. The `base-domains` package is also available to mark your opam project as _requiring_ the `Domains` module, so you can even publish your early multicore-capable libraries to the mainline opam repository now.

- The OCaml standard library was made safe for parallel use by multiple domains ([wiki](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/wiki/Safety-of-Stdlib-under-Multicore-OCaml), [issue](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10453), [fixes](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22stdlib+safety%22+is%3Aclosed)); and in particularly the `Format` and `Random` modules. These modules were the main sources of incompatibilities we found when running existing OCaml code with multiple domains.

* The `Domain` module has had its interface slimmed with the removal of `critical_section`, `wait`, `notify` which has allowed significant runtime simplification. The GC C-API interface is now implemented and this means that Jane Street's `Base`, `Core`, and `Async` now compile on `4.12+domains` without modifications; for example `opam install patdiff` works out of the box on a `4.12+domains` switch!

*  [Domainslib 0.3.0](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/releases/tag/0.3.0) has been released which incorporates multiple improvements including the work-stealing deques for task distribution. The performance of reading domain local variables has also been improved with a primitive and a O(1) lookup.  The chapter on [`Parallel Programming in
Multicore OCaml`](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/parallel-programming-in-multicore-ocaml) has been updated to reflect the latest developments with Domainslib.

This means that big application stacks should now compile pretty well with 4.12.0+domains (applications like the Tezos node and patdiff exercise a lot of the dependency trees in opam). If you do find incompatibilities, please do report them on the [repository](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues).

## 4.12.0+domains+effects

Most of our focus has been on getting the domains-only trees (for OCaml 5.0) up to speed, but we have been progressing the direct-style effects-based IO stack as well.

- The `uring` bindings to Linux Io_uring are now available on opam-repository, so you can try it out on sequential OCaml too. A good mini-project would be to add a uring backend to the existing Async or Lwt engines, if anyone wants to try a substantial contribution.
- The [`eio` library](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio) is fairly usable now, for both filesystem and networking. We've submitted a talk to the OCaml workshop to dive into the innards of it in more detail, so stay tuned for that in the coming months if accepted.  The main changes here have been performance improvements, and the HTTP stack is fairy competitive with (e.g.) `rust-hyper`.

We will soon also have a variant of this tree that removes the custom effect syntax and implements the fibres (the runtime piece) as `Obj` functions.  This will further improve ecosystem compatibility and allow us to build direct-style OCaml libraries that use fibres internally to provide concurrency, but without exposing any use of effects in their interfaces.

## Benchmarking and performance

We are always keen to get more benchmarks that exercise multicore features; if you want to try multicore out and help write benchmarks there are some suggestions on the [wiki](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/wiki/Multicore-benchmarking-projects). We've got a private server which runs a Sandmark nightly benchmark pipeline with Jupyter notebooks, which we can give access to anyone who submits benchmarks. We continue to test integration of Sandmark with [current-bench](https://github.com/ocurrent/current-bench) for better integration with GitHub PRs.

As always, the Multicore OCaml ongoing and completed tasks are listed first, which are then followed by updates from the ecosystem and their associated libraries. The Sandmark benchmarking and nightly build efforts are then mentioned. Finally, the status of the upstream OCaml Safepoints PR is provided for your reference.

  Fix remaining TODOs in API

  The `read` and `write` methods have been renamed to `read_fixed` and

  to `Flow.copy` for better clarity.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#36](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/36)
  Use uring for accept

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#52](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/52)
  Split Linux support out to `eio_linux` library

  `eunix` now has common code that is shared by different backends,
  and `eio_linux` provides a Linux io-uring backend. The tests and the
  documentation have been updated to reflect the change.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#57](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/57)
  Reraise exceptions with backtraces

  Added support to store a reference to a backtrace when a switch
  catches an exception. This is useful when you want to reraise the
  exception later.

* [ocaml-multicore/eio#60](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/60)
  Simplify handling of completions

  The PR adds `Job` and `Job_no_cancel` in `type io_job` along with

  type in Eio API, and replacing `Unix.sockaddr` with a custom type.

#### Sundries

* [ocaml-multicore/eventlog-tools#2](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eventlog-tools/pull/2)
  Add a pausetimes tool

  A `eventlog_pausetimes` tool has been added to `eventlog-tools` that
  takes a directory of eventlog files and computes the mean, max pause
  times, as well as the distribution up to the 99.9th percentiles. For
  example:

  ```json
  ocaml-eventlog-pausetimes /home/engil/dev/ocaml-multicore/trace3/caml-426094-* name
  {
    "name": "name",
    "mean_latency": 718617,
    "max_latency": 33839379,
    "distr_latency": [191,250,707,16886,55829,105386,249272,552640,1325621,13312993,26227671]
  }
  ```

* [ocaml-multicore/kcas#9](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/kcas/pull/9)

  The `Domain.Sync.{critical_section, wait_for}` have now been
  replaced with `Domain.Sync.cpu_relax`, which matches the
  implementation with lockfree.

  Add Eio benchmark

  The Eio benchmark has now been added to the retro-httpaf-bench
  GitHub repository.

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#230](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/230)
  Build for 4.13.0+trunk with dune.2.8.1

  The `ocaml-migrate-parsetree.2.2.0` and `ppxlib.0.22.2` packages are
  now available for 4.13.0+trunk, and we are currently porting the
  Irmin Layers benchmark in Sandmark from using Irmin 2.4 to 2.6.

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#231](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/231)
  View results for a set of benchmarks in the nightly notebooks

  A feature request to filter the list of benchmarks when using the
  Sandmark Jupyter notebooks.

* [ocaml-bench/sandmark#233](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/233)
  Update pausetimes_multicore to fit with the latest Multicore changes

  The pausetimes are now updated for both the 4.12.0 upstream and
  4.12.0 Multicore branches to use the new Common Trace Format
  (CTF). The generated graphs for both the sequential and parallel
  pausetime results are illustrated below:

  Implement pausetimes support in sandmark_nightly

  The sequential and parallel pausetimes graph results need to be
  implemented in the Sandmark nightly Jupyter notebooks. The results
  are similar to the Figures 10 and 12 produced in the [Retrofitting
  Parallelism ont OCaml, ICFP 2020
  paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11663.pdf).

  Run sandmark_nightly on a larger machine

  The testing of Sandmark nightly sequential and parallel benchmark
  runs have been done on a 24-core machine, and we would like to
  deploy the same on a 64+ core machine to benefit from the recent
  improvements to Domainslib.

  Evolutionary Algorithm.

### Completed
