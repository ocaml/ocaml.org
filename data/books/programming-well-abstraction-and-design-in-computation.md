  which introduces different programming paradigms using OCaml.
recommendation: >
  This textbook uses OCaml as the primary language to explore different programming paradigms - imperative, functional, and object-oriented. Through OCaml's multi-paradigm nature, readers learn to solve problems in different ways, considering aspects like correctness, efficiency, readability, and elegance. Suitable for those with basic programming experience, it builds on introductory concepts to examine the difference between programming and programming well.

This textbook is written for Harvard's CS51 Abstraction and Design in Computation class
which uses OCaml to introduce different programming paradigms including imperative, functional, and object-oriented.

CS51 is a second-semester class following the entry-level CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.
It teaches fundamental concepts in the design of computer programs, emphasizing the crucial role of abstraction.
The goal of the course is to give students insight into the difference between programming and programming well.

The book assumes basic programming experience from an introductory computer science course
but does not require prior exposure to functional programming.
