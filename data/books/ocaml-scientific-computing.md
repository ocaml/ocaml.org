This book is about the harmonious synthesis of functional programming and
numerical computation. It shows how the expressiveness of OCaml allows for fast
and safe development of data science applications. Step by step, the authors
build up to use cases drawn from many areas of Data Science, Machine Learning,
and AI, and then delve into how to deploy at scale, using parallel,
distributed, and accelerated frameworks to gain all the advantages of cloud
computing environments.

To this end, the book is divided into three parts, each focusing on a different
area. Part I begins by introducing how basic numerical techniques are performed
in OCaml, including classical mathematical topics (interpolation and
quadrature), statistics, and linear algebra. It moves on from using only scalar
values to multi-dimensional arrays, introducing the tensor and Ndarray, core
data types in any numerical computing system. It concludes with two more
classical numerical computing topics, the solution of Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs) and Signal Processing, as well as introducing the
visualization module we use throughout this book. Part II is dedicated to
advanced optimization techniques that are core to most current popular data
science fields. We do not focus only on applications but also on the basic
building blocks, starting with Algorithmic Differentiation, the most crucial
building block that in turn enables Deep Neural Networks. We follow this with
chapters on Optimization and Regression, also used in building Deep Neural
Networks. We then introduce Deep Neural Networks as well as topic modelling in
Natural Language Processing (NLP), two advanced and currently very active
fields in both industry and academia. Part III collects a range of case studies
demonstrating how you can build a complete numerical application quickly from
scratch using Owl. The cases presented include computer vision and recommender
systems.

This book aims at anyone with a basic knowledge of functional programming and a
desire to explore the world of scientific computing, whether to generally
explore the field in the round, to build applications for particular topics, or
to deep-dive into how numerical systems are constructed. It does not assume
strict ordering in reading â€“ readers can simply jump to the topic that
interests them most.
