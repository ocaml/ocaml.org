This book is about the harmonious synthesis of functional programming and
numerical computation. It shows how the expressiveness of OCaml allows for fast
and safe development of data science applications. Step by step, the authors
build up to use cases drawn from many areas of Data Science, Machine Learning,
and AI, and then delve into how to deploy at scale, using parallel,
distributed, and accelerated frameworks to gain all the advantages of cloud
computing environments.

This book aims at anyone with a basic knowledge of functional programming and a
desire to explore the world of scientific computing, whether to generally
explore the field in the round, to build applications for particular topics, or
to deep-dive into how numerical systems are constructed. It does not assume
strict ordering in reading â€“ readers can simply jump to the topic that
interests them most.
