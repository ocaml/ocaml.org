This text teaches functional programming and the structure of programming languages to beginning students.
It is written for the Programming 1 course for computer science students at Saarland University.
We assume that incoming students are familiar with mathematical thinking,
but we do not assume programming experience. The course is designed
to take about one third of the first semester's study time.

As it comes to functional programming, we cover higher-order recursive functions, polymorphic typing, and constructor types for lists,
trees, and abstract syntax. We emphasise the role of correctness statements and practice inductive correctness proofs. We also cover asymptotic running time considering binary search (logarithmic), insertion sort
(quadratic), merge sort (linearithmic), and other algorithms.

As it comes to the structure of programming languages, we study
the different layers of syntax and semantics at the example of the idealised functional programming language Mini-OCaml. We describe the
syntactic layers with grammar and the semantic layers with inference
rules. Based on these formal descriptions, we program recursive descent
parsers, type checkers and evaluators.
