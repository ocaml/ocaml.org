A textbook on functional programming and data structures in OCaml, with an
emphasis on semantics and software engineering.

This book is used at Cornell for a third-semester programming course. Most
students have had one semester of introductory programming in Python, followed
by one semester of object-oriented programming in Java. Frequent comparisons
are therefore made to those two languages. Readers who have studied similar
languages should have no difficulty following along. The book does not assume
any prior knowledge of functional programming, but it does assume that readers
have prior experience programming in some mainstream imperative language.
Knowledge of discrete mathematics at the level of a standard first-semester CS
course is also assumed.

There are over 200 YouTube videos embedded in this book. They can be watched
independently of reading the book.
