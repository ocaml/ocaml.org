This book teaches OCaml programming with special emphasis on scientific
applications. Many examples are given, covering everything from simple
numerical analysis to sophisticated real-time 3D visualisation using
OpenGL. This book contains over 800 color syntax-highlighted source code
examples and dozens of diagrams that elucidate the power of functional
programming to explain how lightning-fast and yet remarkably-simple
programs can be constructed in the OCaml programming language.
