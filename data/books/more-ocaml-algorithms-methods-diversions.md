In "More OCaml," John Whitington takes a meandering tour of functional
programming with OCaml, introducing various language features and describing
some classic algorithms. The book ends with a large worked example dealing with
the production of PDF files. There are questions for each chapter together with
worked answers and hints.

"More OCaml" will appeal both to existing OCaml programmers who wish to brush up
their skills and to experienced programmers eager to explore functional
languages such as OCaml. It is hoped that each reader will find something new
or see an old thing in a new light. For the more casual reader, or those who are
used to a different functional language, a summary of basic OCaml is provided at
the front of the book.
