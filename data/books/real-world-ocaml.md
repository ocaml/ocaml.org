Learn how to solve day-to-day problems in data processing, numerical
computation, system scripting, and database-driven web applications with
the OCaml multi-paradigm programming language. This hands-on book shows
you how to take advantage of OCaml’s functional, imperative, and
object-oriented programming styles with recipes for many real-world
tasks.

You’ll start with OCaml basics, including how to set up a development
environment, and move toward more advanced topics such as the module
system, foreign-function interface, macro language, and the OCaml tools.
Quickly learn how to put OCaml to work for writing succinct and
readable code.

The code examples in this books uses Jane Street [core library](https://ocaml.org/p/core/latest).
