  This book is organised into three parts. The first one introduces
  OCaml and targets beginners, whether they're programming beginners or
  simply new to OCaml. Through small programs, the reader is introduced
  to fundamental concepts of programming and of OCaml. The second and
  third parts are dedicated to fundamental concepts of algorithmics and
  should allow the reader to write programs in a structured and
  efficient way.

Computer programming is hard to learn. Being a skillful programmer
requires imagination, anticipation, knowledge in algorithmics, the
mastery of a programming language, and above all, experience, as
difficulties are often hidden in details. This book synthesises our
experience as teachers and programmers.

The programming style is essential. Given a programming language, the
same algorithm can be written in multiple ways, and some of them can
be both elegant and efficient. This is what the programmer must seek
at all costs and the reason why we choose a programming language for
this book rather than pseudo-code. Our choice is OCaml.

This book is organised into three parts. The first one introduces
OCaml and targets beginners, whether they're programming beginners or
simply new to OCaml. Through small programs, the reader is introduced
to fundamental concepts of programming and of OCaml. The second and
third parts are dedicated to fundamental concepts of algorithmics and
should allow the reader to write programs in a structured and
efficient way. Algorithmic concepts are directly presented in the
syntax of OCaml and any code snippet from the book is available
online.
