This book is notoriously much more than just an introduction to OCaml,
it describes most of the language, and is accessible.

Abstract: *This book is an introduction to ML programming, specifically for the OCaml programming language from INRIA. OCaml is a dialect of the ML family of languages, which derive from the Classic ML language designed by Robin Milner in 1975 for the LCF (Logic of Computable Functions) theorem prover.*
