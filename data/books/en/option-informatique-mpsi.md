This is a computer science course for the first year of “classes
préparatoires”. The course begins with an introductory lesson on
algorithms and a description of the OCaml language. Then, several
fundamental algorithms are described and illustrated using OCaml
programs. The book adopts a mathematical approach: descriptions of
mathematical objects are related to data structures in the programming
language. This book is suitable for students with some mathematical
background, and for everyone who wants to learn the bases of computer
science.
