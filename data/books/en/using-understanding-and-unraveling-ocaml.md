This book describes both the OCaml language and the theoretical grounds
behind its powerful type system. A good complement to other books on
OCaml it is addressed to a wide audience of people interested in modern programming languages in general, ML-like languages in particular, or simply in OCaml, whether they are programmers or language designers, beginners or knowledgeable readers — little prerequisite is actually assumed.
