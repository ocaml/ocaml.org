This book offers sixteen problems in computer science, with detailed
answers to all questions and complete solutions to algorithmic problems
given as OCaml programs. It deals mainly with automata, finite or
infinite words, formal language theory, and some classical algorithms
such as bin-packing. It is intended for students who attend the optional
computer science curriculum of the “classes préparatoires MPSI/MP”. It
should also be useful to all teachers and computer science students up
to a masters degree.
