This book is intended for beginners, who will learn basic programming
notions. The first part of the book is a programming course that
initiates the reader to the OCaml language. Important notions are
presented from a practical point of view, and the implementation of some
of these is analyzed and sketched. The second part, the “OCaml
workshop”, is a practical application of these notions to other domains
connected to computer science, logic, automata and grammars.
