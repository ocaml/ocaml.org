This book presents a new approach to teaching programming concepts to
beginners, based on language semantics. A simplified semantic model is
used to describe in a precise manner the features found in most
programming languages. This model is powerful enough to explain
typechecking, polymorphism, evaluation, side-effects, modularity,
exceptions. Yet, it is simple enough to be manipulated by hand, so that
students can actually use it to compute. The book begins with a
functional approach, based on OCaml, and continues with a presentation
of an imperative language, namely Ada. It also provides numerous
exercises with solutions.
