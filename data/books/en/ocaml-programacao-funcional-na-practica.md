This book is an introduction to functional programming through OCaml, with a pragmatic
focus. The goal is to enable the reader to write real programs in OCaml and understand
most of the open source code written in the language. It includes many code examples
illustrating the topics and a few larger projects written in OCaml that showcase the
integration of many language features. These larger
programs include a set of interpreter, compiler and stack machine for a simple
language, and a decision tree learning program for data analysis.
