Learn how to solve day-to-day problems in data processing, numerical
computation, system scripting, and database-driven web applications with
the OCaml multi-paradigm programming language. This hands-on book shows
you how to take advantage of OCaml’s functional, imperative, and
object-oriented programming styles with recipes for many real-world
tasks.

You’ll start with OCaml basics, including how to set up a development
environment, and move toward more advanced topics such as the module
system, foreign-function interface, macro language, and the OCaml tools.
Quickly learn how to put OCaml to work for writing succinct and
readable code.
