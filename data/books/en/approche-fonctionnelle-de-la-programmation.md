This book uses OCaml as a tool to introduce several important
programming concepts. It is divided in three parts. The first part is an
introduction to OCaml, which presents the language itself, but also
introduces evaluation by rewriting, evaluation strategies and proofs of
programs by induction. The second part is dedicated to the description
of application programs which belong to various fields and might
interest various types of readers or students. Finally, the third part
is dedicated to implementation. It describes interpretation then
compilation, with brief descriptions of memory management and type
synthesis.
