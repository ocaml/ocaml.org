This book is a work in progress. It is an introductory programming
textbook based on the OCaml language. It is a modified version of
Think Python by Allen Downey. It is intended for newcomers to
programming and also those who know some programming but want to learn
programming in the function-oriented paradigm, or those who simply
want to learn OCaml.
