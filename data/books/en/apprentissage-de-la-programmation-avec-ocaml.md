Programming is a discipline by which the strengths of computers can be
harnessed: large amounts of reliable memory, the ability to execute
repetitive tasks relentlessly, and a high computation speed. In order to
write correct programs that fulfill their specified needs, it is
necessary to understand the precise semantics of the programming
language. This book is targeted towards beginner programmers and
provides teaching material for all programmers wishing to learn the
functional programming style. The programming features introduced in
this book are available in all dialects of the ML language, notably
Caml-Light, OCaml and Standard ML. The concepts presented therein and
illustrated in OCaml easily transpose to other programming languages.
