This book gives an introduction to programming where algorithms as well
as data structures are considered functionally. It is intended as an
accompanying book for basic courses in computer science, but it is also
suitable for self-studies. In the first part, algorithms are described
in a concise and precise manner using Caml Light. The second part
provides a tutorial introduction into the language Caml Light and in its
last chapter a comprehensive description of the language kernel.
