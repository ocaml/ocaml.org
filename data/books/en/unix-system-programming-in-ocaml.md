This is an excellent book on Unix system programming, with an emphasis
on communications between processes. The main novelty of this work is
the use of OCaml, instead of the C language that is customary in systems
programming. This gives an unusual perspective on systems programming
and on OCaml. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with OCaml and
Unix shell commands.
