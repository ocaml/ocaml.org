Matrix Lead provides professionals and companies with leading technologies and solutions for spreadsheets. We create a range of software to help users better build, verify, optimize and manage their spreadsheets. Our flagship product [10 Studio](https://www.10studio.tech) is a Microsoft Excel add-in that combines our several advanced tools, such as formula editor and spreadsheet verificator. The kernel of our tools is an analyzer that analyzes different properties of spreadsheets (including formulas and VBA macros) especially by abstract interpretation-based static analysis. It was initially developed in the Antiques team of Inria and written in OCaml. Then, we wrap web or .NET languages around the analyzer to make ready-to-use tools.
