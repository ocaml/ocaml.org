XenServer, part of Cloud Software Group, is a world-class server virtualization system and includes many components written in OCaml.
The open-source XenServer toolstack components implemented in OCaml are bundled in the [XS-opam](https://github.com/xapi-project/xs-opam) repository on GitHub.

(Note: XenServer used to be part of Citrix, branded as Citrix Hypervisor, now it is XenServer again)
