OCamlPro was created in 2011 to promote the use of languages with formal grounds and strong static typing, such as OCaml and Rust, thanks to a strong connection with both academia and industry. Along the years, OCamlPro has participated in many projects for the OCaml community and for its clients:

 - tooling for OCaml developers, such as the Opam package manager or the Flambda optimizing compilers,
 - development of complex software, such as the prototype and ICO platform of the Tezos blockchain,
 - new languages/DSLs and tooling for other languages, such as the SuperBOL LSP for COBOL on Vscode or OWI for WebAssembly symbolic testing,
 - code analyzis and code verification, such as the Alt-Ergo SMT solver or the SeaCoral unittest generator,
 - audits, consulting and support
 - training in OCaml and Rust
