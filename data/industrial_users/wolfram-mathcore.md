Wolfram MathCore uses OCaml to implement its SystemModeler kernel. The kernel's main function is to translate models defined in the Modelica language into executable simulation code. This involves parsing and transforming Modelica code, mathematical processing of equations, code generation of C/C++ simulation code, and numerical runtime computations.
