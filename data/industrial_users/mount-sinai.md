The [Hammer Lab]("https://www.hammerlab.org") at Mount Sinai develops and uses [Ketrew]("https://github.com/hammerlab/ketrew") for managing complex bioinformatics workflows. Ketrew includes an embedded domain-specific language to simplify the specification of workflows and an engine for the execution of workflows. Ketrew can be run as a command-line application or as a service.
