Psellos is a small group of computer scientists who became intrigued by the idea of coding iOS apps in OCaml. It has worked out better than we expected (you can buy our apps in the iTunes App Store), and at least one other company sells apps built with our tools. Our most recent iOS cross compiler is derived from OCaml 4.00.0.
