Cacaoweb is developing an application platform of a new kind. It runs on top of our peer-to-peer network, which happens to be one of the largest in the world. The capabilities of the platform are diverse and range from multimedia streaming to social communication, offline storage or data synchronisation. We design and implement massively distributed data stores, programming languages, runtime systems and parallel computation frameworks.
