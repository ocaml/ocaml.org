Issuu is a digital publishing platform delivering exceptional reading experiences of magazines, catalogues, and newspapers. Each month Issuu serves over 6 billion page views and 60 million users through their worldwide network. OCaml is used as part of the server-side systems, platforms, and web applications. The backend team is relatively small and the simplicity and scalability of both systems and processes are of vital importance.
