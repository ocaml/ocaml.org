We are building and maintaining open-source infrastructure tools in OCaml:

 - [MirageOS](https://mirage.io), the most advanced unikernel project, where we build sandboxes, network and storage protocol implementations as libraries, so we can link them to our applications to run them without the need of an underlying operating system.
 - [Irmin]("https://irmin.org"), a Git-like datastore, which allows us to create fully auditable distributed systems which can work offline and be synced when needed.
 - OCaml development tools (build system, code linters, documentation generators, etc), to make us more efficient. 
  
Tarides was founded in early 2018 and is mainly based in Paris, France (remote work is possible).
