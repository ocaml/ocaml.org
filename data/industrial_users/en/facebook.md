Facebook has built a number of major development tools using OCaml. [Hack](https://hacklang.org) is a compiler for a variant of PHP that aims to reconcile the fast development cycle of PHP with the discipline provided by static typing. [Flow](https://flowtype.org) is a similar project that provides static type checking for Javascript.  Both systems are highly responsive, parallel programs that can incorporate source code changes in real time. [Pfff](https://github.com/facebook/pfff/wiki/Main) is a set of tools for code analysis, visualizations, and style-preserving source transformations, written in OCaml, but supporting many languages.
