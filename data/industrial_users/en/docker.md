Docker provides an integrated technology suite that enables development and IT operations teams to build, ship, and run distributed applications anywhere. Their native [applications for Mac and Windows](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/), use OCaml code taken from the [MirageOS](https://mirage.io) library operating system project.
