Nomadic Labs houses a team focused on Research and Development. Our
core competencies are in programming language theory and practice,
distributed systems, and formal verification. Nomadic Labs focuses on
contributing to the development of the Tezos core software, including
the smart-contract language, Michelson.

Tezos infrastructure is entirely implemented in OCaml. It strongly
relies on OCaml efficiency and expressivity. For instance, Michelson
smart contracts are represented using OCaml GADTs to prevent many
runtime errors from happening. Safety and correctness are critical for a
blockchain and we are glad that the OCaml type system allows for a
form of a lightweight formal method that can be used on a daily basis.
