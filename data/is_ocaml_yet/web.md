      OCaml has excellent support for running in the browser!
      The [Js_of_ocaml](/p/js_of_ocaml/latest) compiler, which translates OCaml into JavaScript, is a well-established tool dating back to 2010. It integrates seamlessly with the existing OCaml ecosystem and powers numerous production applications.

      In addition, [Melange](/p/melange/latest) is a more recent entry to the OCaml-JavaScript compiler space. Originating as a fork of [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/), Melange may not have the extensive track record of Js_of_ocaml, but it builds on a very strong foundation and already integrates well with Dune, the OCaml build system.

OCaml, traditionally known for its strength in systems programming, formal verification, and as the language of choice for numerous academic endeavors, is steadily maturing in the Web development landscape. With its strong static typing, emphasis on immutability, and excellent performance, it is gradually making a case for itself as a viable alternative to mainstream Web development languages.

The Web in OCaml is fast and type-safe! According to your needs, you can
choose to use tidy server-side Web frameworks, or innovative full-stack
solutions for integrated Web and mobile applications. To run in the
browser, OCaml compiles to JavaScript and WebAssembly!

As a matter of fact, OCaml is used to power production Web systems, like
[Ahrefs](/success-stories/peta-byte-scale-web-crawler),
[OCaml.org](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org) or the [Be
Sport](https://besport.com/news) social network.

If you're considering using OCaml for your next Web application, you
should be aware that you might have to write a noticeable amount of
things yourself and won't yet get an equivalent of all the features you
may be used to coming from other languages. In particular, OCaml doesn't
have out-of-the-box solutions for authentication or a fully
production-ready query-builder. You'll also probably have some
challenges if you need to interact with external services or external
APIs.

However, this is often more than offset by the time you save thanks to
the advantages of the language and the power of certain tools. The
language's powerful type system will save you a lot of debugging time by
eliminating many problems at compile time (such as HTML conformity).
Innovative solutions such as multi-tier programming can drastically
simplify client-server communication. Last but not least, OCaml can even
allow you to program your Web and mobile application in a single code.

## Want to Help?

Here are some projects that would help make OCaml a stronger candidate for Web applications:
- Improve [ocaml-swagger](https://github.com/andrenth/ocaml-swagger) to be able to generate API for popular Web APIs like Stripe.
- Create an OAuth2 client library.
- Create clients to the Azure services APIs.
