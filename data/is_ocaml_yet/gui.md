OCaml, traditionally known for its strength in systems programming, formal verification, and as the language of choice for numerous academic endeavors, is steadily maturing in the GUI development landscape.

With its strong static typing, emphasis on immutability, and excellent performance, it is gradually making a case for itself as a viable alternative to mainstream GUI development languages.

OCaml has libraries that aid an easy integration and usage of Graphical User Interface (GUI). It offers a range of GUI libraries, each with unique features and capabilities. These libraries allow developers to create user interfaces for their applications.
