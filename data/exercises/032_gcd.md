# Solution

```ocaml
# let rec gcd a b =
    if b = 0 then a else gcd b (a mod b);;
val gcd : int -> int -> int = <fun>
```

# Statement

Determine the greatest common divisor of two positive integer numbers.

Use Euclid's algorithm.

```ocaml
# gcd 13 27;;
- : int = 1
# gcd 20536 7826;;
- : int = 2
```
