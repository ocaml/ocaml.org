```ocaml
let factors n =
  let rec aux d n =
    if n = 1 then [] else
      if n mod d = 0 then
        match aux d (n / d) with
        | (h, n) :: t when h = d -> (h, n + 1) :: t
        | l -> (d, 1) :: l
      else aux (d + 1) n
  in
    aux 2 n
```

# Solution

```ocaml
(* Naive power function. *)
let rec pow n p = if p < 1 then 1 else n * pow n (p - 1)

(* [factors] is defined in the previous question. *)
let phi_improved n =
  let rec aux acc = function
    | [] -> acc
    | (p, m) :: t -> aux ((p - 1) * pow p (m - 1) * acc) t
  in
    aux 1 (factors n)
```

# Statement

See problem "[Calculate Euler&#39;s totient function φ(m)](#34)" for
the definition of Euler's totient function. If the list of the prime
factors of a number m is known in the form of the previous problem then
the function phi(m) can be efficiently calculated as follows: Let
`[(p1, m1); (p2, m2); (p3, m3); ...]` be the list of prime factors
(and their multiplicities) of a given number m. Then φ(m) can be
calculated with the following formula:

φ(m) = (p1 - 1) × p1<sup>m1 - 1</sup> × (p2 - 1) ×
p2<sup>m2 - 1</sup> × (p3 - 1) × p3<sup>m3 - 1</sup> × ⋯

```ocaml
# phi_improved 10;;
- : int = 4
# phi_improved 13;;
- : int = 12
```
