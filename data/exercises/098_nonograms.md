# Solution

Brute force solution: construct boards trying all the fill
possibilities for the columns given the prescribed patterns for them
and reject the solution if it does not satisfy the row patterns.


```ocaml
# type element = Empty | X (* ensure we do not miss cases in patterns *);;
type element = Empty | X
```

You may want to look at
[more efficient algorithms](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10489-009-0200-0)
and implement them so you can solve the following within reasonable time:

```ocaml
  solve [[14]; [1; 1]; [7; 1]; [3; 3]; [2; 3; 2];
         [2; 3; 2]; [1; 3; 6; 1; 1]; [1; 8; 2; 1]; [1; 4; 6; 1]; [1; 3; 2; 5; 1; 1];
         [1; 5; 1]; [2; 2]; [2; 1; 1; 1; 2]; [6; 5; 3]; [12]]
        [[7]; [2; 2]; [2; 2]; [2; 1; 1; 1; 1]; [1; 2; 4; 2];
         [1; 1; 4; 2]; [1; 1; 2; 3]; [1; 1; 3; 2]; [1; 1; 1; 2; 2; 1]; [1; 1; 5; 1; 2];
         [1; 1; 7; 2]; [1; 6; 3]; [1; 1; 3; 2]; [1; 4; 3]; [1; 3; 1];
         [1; 2; 2]; [2; 1; 1; 1; 1]; [2; 2]; [2; 2]; [7]]
```

# Statement

Around 1994, a certain kind of puzzles was very popular in England. The
"Sunday Telegraph" newspaper wrote: "Nonograms are puzzles from Japan
and are currently published each week only in The Sunday Telegraph.
Simply use your logic and skill to complete the grid and reveal a
picture or diagram." As an OCaml programmer, you are in a better
situation: you can have your computer do the work!

The puzzle goes like this: Essentially, each row and column of a
rectangular bitmap is annotated with the respective lengths of its
distinct strings of occupied cells. The person who solves the puzzle
must complete the bitmap given only these lengths.

          Problem statement:          Solution:

          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 3         |_|X|X|X|_|_|_|_| 3
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 2 1       |X|X|_|X|_|_|_|_| 2 1
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 3 2       |_|X|X|X|_|_|X|X| 3 2
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 2 2       |_|_|X|X|_|_|X|X| 2 2
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 6         |_|_|X|X|X|X|X|X| 6
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 1 5       |X|_|X|X|X|X|X|_| 1 5
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 6         |X|X|X|X|X|X|_|_| 6
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 1         |_|_|_|_|X|_|_|_| 1
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 2         |_|_|_|X|X|_|_|_| 2
           1 3 1 7 5 3 4 3             1 3 1 7 5 3 4 3
           2 1 5 1                     2 1 5 1
```

For the example above, the problem can be stated as the two lists
`[[3]; [2; 1]; [3; 2]; [2; 2]; [6]; [1; 5]; [6]; [1]; [2]]` and
`[[1; 2]; [3; 1]; [1; 5]; [7; 1]; [5]; [3]; [4]; [3]]` which give the "solid"
lengths of the rows and columns, top-to-bottom and left-to-right,
respectively. Published puzzles are larger than this example, e.g.
25Ã—20, and apparently always have unique solutions.

```ocaml
# solve [[3]; [2; 1]; [3; 2]; [2; 2]; [6]; [1; 5]; [6]; [1]; [2]]
      [[1; 2]; [3; 1]; [1; 5]; [7; 1]; [5]; [3]; [4]; [3]];;
```
