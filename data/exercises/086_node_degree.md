## Solution

```ocaml
(* example pending *);;
```

## Statement

* Write a function `degree graph node` that determines the degree of a
 given node.
* Write a function that generates a list of all nodes of a graph
 sorted according to decreasing degree.
* Use [Welsh-Powell&#39;s
 algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Greedy_coloring)
 to paint the nodes of a graph in such a way that adjacent nodes have
 different colors.
