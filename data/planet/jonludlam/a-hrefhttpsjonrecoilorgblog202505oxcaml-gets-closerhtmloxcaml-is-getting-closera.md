<section><h1><a href="https://jon.recoil.org/atom.xml#oxcaml-is-getting-closer..." class="anchor"></a>OxCaml is getting closer...</h1><ul class="at-tags"><li class="published"><span class="at-tag">published</span> <p>2025-05-02</p></li></ul><p>I joined the OxCaml weekly meeting representing Tarides for the first time this week, as Jane Street gear up to an official release of their OxCaml compiler.</p><p>It seems that mainly what needs to be done before the release can be made is to ensure there is some reasonable documentation for the new features, and that a reasonable number of packages are working, so people are furiously writing and bugfixing to try and get this ready.</p><p>As well as this though, there are some challenges of a more organisational level that will need to be addressed to ensure the success of the project. Jane Street have long had a public branch of their compiler, but while they've had patches internally to ensure the tooling and other libraries work, these patches haven't previously been made public in a usable way. In order for OxCaml to be useful, it will clearly need these patches not only to be available, but also to be maintained and to easily allow contributions from the community -- in short, they need to be properly Open Source!</p><p>Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing their branch of <a href="https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/">odoc</a> and having a look to see how the modes will fit into the documentation. I'm also keen to see whether the <a href="https://jon.recoil.org/04/this-site.html" title="this-site">notebook features</a> I've been working on can be ported over to run on OxCaml!</p></section><p>Continue reading <a href="https://jon.recoil.org/blog/2025/05/oxcaml-gets-closer.html">here</a></p>
