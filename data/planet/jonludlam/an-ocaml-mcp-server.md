<section><h1><a href="https://jon.recoil.org/atom.xml#an-ocaml-mcp-server" class="anchor"></a>An OCaml MCP server</h1><ul class="at-tags"><li class="published"><span class="at-tag">published</span> <p>2025-08-20</p></li></ul><ul class="at-tags"><li class="notanotebook"><span class="at-tag">notanotebook</span> </li></ul><p>LLMs are proving themselves superbly capable of a variety of coding tasks, having been trained against the enormous amount of code, tutorials and manuals available online. However, with smaller languages like OCaml there simply isn't enough training material out there, particularly when it comes to new language features like <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.3/effects.html">effects</a> or new packages that haven't had time to be widely used. With my colleagues <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/">Anil</a>, <a href="https://ryan.freumh.org/">Ryan</a> and <a href="https://toao.com/">Sadiq</a> we've been exploring ways to <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/cresting-the-ocaml-ai-hump">improve this situation</a>. One way we can mitigate these challenges is to provide a Model Context Protocol (<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io">MCP</a>) server that's capable of providing up-to-date info on the current state of the OCaml world.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/mcp">MCP specification</a> was released by Anthropic at the end of last year. Since then it has become an astonishingly popular mechanism for extending the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to become incredibly powerful agents capable of much more than simply chatting. There are now a huge variety of MCP servers, from one that provides <a href="https://github.com/r-huijts/firstcycling-mcp">professional cycling data</a> to one that can <a href="https://github.com/GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server">do your email</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers">awesome mcp server list</a> already lists hundreds, and these are just the <em>awesome</em> ones!</p><p>I've been working with <a href="https://toao.com/">Sadiq</a> to make an <a href="https://github.com/sadiqj/odoc-llm/">MCP server for OCaml</a>, with an initial focus on building it such that it can be hosted for everyone rather than something that is run locally. Our plan is to start with a service that can help with choosing OCaml libraries, by taking advantage of the work done by <a href="https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-docs-ci/">ocaml-docs-ci</a> which is the tool used to generate the documentation for all packages in <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">opam-repository</a> and is served by <a href="https://ocaml.org/">ocaml.org</a>. As well as producing HTML docs, we can also extract a number of other formats from the pipeline, including a newly created <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1341">markdown backend</a>. Using this, we can get markdown-formatted documentation for the every version of every package in the OCaml ecosystem.</p></section><p>Continue reading <a href="https://jon.recoil.org/blog/2025/08/ocaml-mcp-server.html">here</a></p>
