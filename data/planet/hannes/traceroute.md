<p>This means with a traceroute utility you can investigate which route is taken
to a destination host, and what the round trip time(s) on the path are. The
sample output above is taken from a virtual machine on my laptop to the remote
host 198.167.222.207. You can see there are 17 hops between us, with the first
being my laptop with a tiny round trip time of 351us, the second and third are
using private IP addresses, and are my home network. The round trip time of the
fourth hop is much higher, this is the first hop on the other side of my DSL
modem. You can see various hops on the public Internet: the packets pass from
my Internet provider's backbone across some exchange points to the destination
Internet provider somewhere in Sweden.</p>
<p>The implementation of traceroute relies mainly on the time-to-live (ttl) field
(in IPv6 lingua it is &quot;hop limit&quot;) of IP packets, which is meant to avoid route
cycles that would infinitely forward IP packets in circles. Every router, when
forwarding an IP packet, first checks that the ttl field is greater than zero,
and then forwards the IP packet where the ttl is decreased by one. If the ttl
field is zero, instead of forwarding, an ICMP time exceeded packet is sent back
to the source.</p>
<p>Traceroute works by exploiting this mechanism: a series of IP packets with
increasing ttls is sent to the destination. Since upfront the length of the
path is unknown, it is a reactive system: first send an IP packet with a ttl of
one, if a ICMP time exceeded packet is returned, send an IP packet with a ttl of
two, etc. -- until an ICMP packet of type destination unreachable is received.
Since some hosts do not reply with a time exceeded message, it is crucial for
not getting stuck to use a timeout for each packet: when the timeout is reached,
an IP packet with an increased ttl is sent and an unknown for the ttl is
printed (see the fifth hop in the example above).</p>
<p>The packets send out are conventionally UDP packets without payload. From a
development perspective, one question is how to correlate the ICMP packet
with the sent UDP packet. Conveniently, ICMP packets contain the IP header and
the first eight bytes of the next protocol - the UDP header containing source
port, destination port, checksum, and payload length (each fields of size two
bytes). This means when we record the outgoing ports together with the sent
timestamp, and correlate the later received ICMP packet to the sent packet.
Great.</p>
<p>But as a functional programmer, let's figure whether we can abolish the
(globally shared) state. Since the ICMP packet contains the original IP
header and the first eight bytes of the UDP header, this is where we will
embed data. As described above, the data is the sent timestamp and the value
of the ttl field. For the latter, we can arbitrarily restrict it to 31 (5 bits).
For the timestamp, it is mainly a question about precision and maximum expected
round trip time. Taking the source and destination port are 32 bits, using 5 for
ttl, remaining are 27 bits (an unsigned value up to 134217727). Looking at the
decimal representation, 1 second is likely too small, 13 seconds are sufficient
for the round trip time measurement. This implies our precision is 100ns, by
counting the digits.</p>
<p>Finally to the code. First we need forth and back conversions between ports
and ttl, timestamp:</p>
<pre><code class="language-OCaml">(* takes a time-to-live (int) and timestamp (int64, nanoseconda), encodes them
   into 16 bit source port and 16 bit destination port:
   - the timestamp precision is 100ns (thus, it is divided by 100)
   - use the bits 27-11 of the timestamp as source port
   - use the bits 11-0 as destination port, and 5 bits of the ttl
*)
let ports_of_ttl_ts ttl ts =
  let ts = Int64.div ts 100L in
  let src_port = 0xffff land (Int64.(to_int (shift_right ts 11)))
  and dst_port = 0xffe0 land (Int64.(to_int (shift_left ts 5))) lor (0x001f land ttl)
  in
  src_port, dst_port

(* inverse operation of ports_of_ttl_ts for the range (src_port and dst_port
   are 16 bit values) *)
let ttl_ts_of_ports src_port dst_port =
  let ttl = 0x001f land dst_port in
  let ts =
    let low = Int64.of_int (dst_port lsr 5)
    and high = Int64.(shift_left (of_int src_port) 11)
    in
    Int64.add low high
  in
  let ts = Int64.mul ts 100L in
  ttl, ts
</code></pre>
<p>They should be inverse over the range of valid input: ports are 16 bit numbers,
ttl expected to be at most 31, ts a int64 expressed in nanoseconds.</p>
<p>Related is the function to print out one hop and round trip measurement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-OCaml">(* write a log line of a hop: the number, IP address, and round trip time *)
let log_one now ttl sent ip =
  let now = Int64.(mul (logand (div now 100L) 0x7FFFFFFL) 100L) in
  let duration = Mtime.Span.of_uint64_ns (Int64.sub now sent) in
  Logs.info (fun m -&gt; m &quot;%2d  %a  %a&quot; ttl Ipaddr.V4.pp ip Mtime.Span.pp duration)
