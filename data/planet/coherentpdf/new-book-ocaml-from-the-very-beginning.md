<p>Reviews on Amazon are always very useful &ndash; my understanding is that if  you have an amazon account, you can review the book based on having read  the e-book, without buying a printed copy. Do please consider adding a  review, especially if you like the book!</p>
<p>Some of the data might not have yet propagated to all Amazon subsidiaries, but it ought to do so over the next few hours or days.</p>
