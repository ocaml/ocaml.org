<p>I&rsquo;ve been packaging up some little pieces of previously-released software as OPAM packages, hoping that will make them more widely used.</p>
<p>GraphicsPDF is just like Graphics, but it outputs a PDF file of the commands, instead of displaying them on screen.</p>
<p>The development repository is <a href="https://github.com/johnwhitington/graphicspdf">at github</a></p>
<p>The easiest way to install is through OPAM:</p>
<p>opam install graphicspdf</p>
<p>It was originally described in <a href="https://coherentpdf.com/blog/?p=45">this blog post</a> some years ago.</p>
