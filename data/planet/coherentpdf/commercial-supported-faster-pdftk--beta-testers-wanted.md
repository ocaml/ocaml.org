<p>We&rsquo;re writing a front end for our PDF tools with the same command line interface as <a href="http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/">pdftk</a>, so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for pdftk for people who can&rsquo;t compile pdftk on their system and don&rsquo;t want to change to our normal command line system cpdf, or who want a supported, commercial pdftk.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for people who used pdftk regularly, either manually or as part of automated systems, to join in testing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested please use the contact form on the front page at <a href="http://www.coherentpdf.com/"> http://www.coherentpdf.com/</a> and send a couple of sentences about how you use pdftk. </p>
