<p>The first new release of the CamlPDF library for a while is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.github.com/johnwhitington/camlpdf" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://www.github.com/johnwhitington/camlpdf</a></p>
<p>(Or, shortly, via OPAM.)</p>
<p>The documentation is online here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coherentpdf.com/camlpdf" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://www.coherentpdf.com/camlpdf</a></p>
<p>A little introduction is here:</p>

<p>Most importantly, CamlPDF is now open source, being under a standard  LGPL with linking exception licence.</p>
<p>This release is much cleaner: development has moved to Github for  transparency, ocamlfind is supported, and it should compile  out-of-the-box with no dependencies on Windows, Mac and Linux.  Documentation is much improved.</p>
<p>And, of course, there&rsquo;s lots of new functionality, such as 256 bit AES  encryption, reading of malformed files, support for writing with object  streams, and new modules for merging files, bookmarks, destinations.  It&rsquo;s also very much faster.</p>
<p>There have, however, been significant non-backward-compatible API  changes. These will be minimized in the future. Contact me directly or  via the Github issue system if you need help updating code from a  previous version.</p>
