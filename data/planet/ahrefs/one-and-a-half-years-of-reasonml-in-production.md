Since then, many more applications have been either rewritten in Reason, are being slowly migrated from React to ReasonReact, or are conceived from the start as Reason projects. It is safe to say that the bet placed on Reason paid off big time. We will never go back to doing pure JavaScript again, with the possible exception of simple backend&nbsp;scripts.</p><p>In the past few years, it&rsquo;s come to light that there are a number of other <a href="https://www.messenger.com/">large</a> <a href="https://www.onegraph.com/">Reason</a>/<a href="https://darklang.com/">BuckleScript</a> <a href="https://onivim.io/">codebases</a> in the wild, but there still isn&rsquo;t a ton of information out there about what it&rsquo;s really like to work with Reason in production. To help remedy that, we thought it would be instructive to ask each of our frontend team members what their Reason journey has been like so&nbsp;far.</p><p>We gave them the following questions as starting points (but they were free to talk about anything they&nbsp;wanted):</p><ul><li>How does Reason compare to other languages you&rsquo;ve used in the&nbsp;past?</li><li>What&rsquo;s your favorite thing about&nbsp;Reason?</li><li>What&rsquo;s your least favorite thing about&nbsp;Reason?</li><li>How does ReasonReact compare to other frameworks you&rsquo;ve&nbsp;used?</li><li>Was it easy to pick up Reason? Why or why&nbsp;not?</li></ul><h4>Javi</h4><ul><li>How does Reason compare to other languages you&rsquo;ve used in the&nbsp;past?</li></ul><p>In the past I worked with languages like Java, C, or less known like Pascal or Prolog. But the languages I&rsquo;ve spent more time with are Objective-C and JavaScript. The main difference between all those languages and Reason is the exhaustiveness that you get from OCaml type checker. This is maybe awkward, but it feels like you stop coding alone and suddenly you have a sidekick always sitting next to you, that is helping you notice the things you forgot about, or found new code that is not consistent with code you or someone else wrote&nbsp;before.</p><p>In a world that is moving towards remote work, where many of us spend hours every day coding physically far from our colleagues, it makes the experience much more delightful. Plus, it allows for teams working on different time zones to keep a healthier work-life balance, because there is less need to have synchronous communication than with more dynamic languages, as more assumptions and design decisions are &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; into the&nbsp;code.</p><ul><li>What&rsquo;s your favorite thing about&nbsp;Reason?</li></ul><p>Can I pick two things? It&rsquo;s hard to choose only&nbsp;one.</p><p>The first one is the exhaustiveness and quality of the type checker, as mentioned above. Sometimes it takes a bit longer to build a feature than what it would in other languages, until the types are figured out. But this is largely compensated by the confidence one has when shipping code to production, or diving into large refactors.</p><p>The second one is the speed of the BuckleScript build system, which is built on top of <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">ninja</a>. I had never worked with such fast build system. As an example, we have recently started to use remote machines to develop at Ahrefs. In one of these machines that has 72 cores, BuckleScript takes roughly 3 seconds to clean build <em>all</em> our Reason code: application, libs, decoders&hellip; everything. Many tens of thousand lines of code! We thought there were something wrong, but we realized the compiler is just So Blazing&nbsp;Fast&trade;&#65039;.</p><ul><li>What&rsquo;s your least favorite thing about&nbsp;Reason?</li></ul><p>I guess we&rsquo;re going through a necessary stage until things stabilize in the future, but there is a lot of fragmentation at the moment between &ldquo;Reason native&rdquo;, which tries to stay closer to OCaml, and &ldquo;Reason web&rdquo;, which has a goal to become friendlier for JavaScript developers.</p><p>I am excited to see what <a href="https://reasonml.org/blog/bucklescript-8-1-new-syntax">BuckleScript new syntax</a> will lead to, but I would also love to see a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; solution that works for the main use cases out of the box, becoming sort of Rails for Ocaml or Reason. <a href="https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl/">sihl</a> is a project that seems to go in that direction and looks very promising.</p><ul><li>How does ReasonReact compare to other frameworks you&rsquo;ve&nbsp;used?</li></ul><p>I consider ReasonReact mostly like React + types on top, because the bindings layer is very thin. The thing that I like most about React is that it follows the Unix philosophy: it does one thing and it does it really well. Maybe we have forgotten already today, but having to maintain and mutate UI based on data updates was one of the main sources of bugs in the past. The other nice thing is that there is so much good content about it: blog posts, documentation, etc.</p><ul><li>Was it easy to pick up Reason? Why or why&nbsp;not?</li></ul><p>It took some time, as with any other language. We have things like syntax or semantics much more ingrained into our brains than we think, so there is always some &ldquo;rewiring&rdquo; time that is needed to learn a new language, even if Reason makes an effort to stay close to JavaScript syntax. The most challenging part was probably the bindings one, because coming from JavaScript, there are no previous knowledge that one can use as foundation to build upon, it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;new knowledge&rdquo;. glennsl <a href="https://github.com/glennsl/bucklescript-ffi-cheatsheet">BuckleScript ffi cheatsheet</a> was a huge help for&nbsp;me.</p><h4>Ze</h4><p>I really like working with Reason, and have wanted to do so for a while. I was quite happy to see that working with it matched my expectations.</p><p>You get so much support from the type system, and still have a lot of flexibility to represent your domain model. Coming from other languages or paradigms, you don&rsquo;t feel limited at all in what you can&nbsp;achieve.</p><p>The language has such a strong type system that you feel much more comfortable with your&nbsp;coding.</p><p>The OCaml type system is there to make sure you code with assurance. This is especially true when refactoring code. You can be sure that everything will work fine after it compiles. If it compiles, it works&nbsp;:)</p><p>It&rsquo;s also very helpful when working on a monorepo. You don&rsquo;t have to keep reading the source code of everything you use to make sure you don&rsquo;t have types mistakes. Changes in code in one lib reflect immediately in all the others. This makes the feedback loop much shorter and&nbsp;safer.</p><p>The editors integrations with the type system are quite good and help a lot to write code better and&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Also, compilation times are super&nbsp;fast.</p><p>Last, but not least, ReasonReact is, for me, the hidden gem of ReasonML. The newcomers that have some difficulty with the language should start with it. IMHO, ReasonReact is simpler and has a better developer experience than React itself. It should be the gateway drug frontend developers need to get started with Reason/OCaml &#128516;</p><h4>Liubomyr</h4><p>To me, all those language features boil down to one essential thing, and it&rsquo;s the easiness of refactoring. New business requirements popups all the time, and often your initial code assumptions are no longer correct. It was such a pain to modify code in a large JS codebase, as you never know how many things you potentially break in the process. With Reason, it has never been easier. If you need to change your data shape or some component API, you just do it, and from there, the compiler will guide you through all the places you broke, and help to fix&nbsp;those.</p><p>Coming from the JS world, it feels like the initial development is slower, because of the learning curve, missing bindings, less StackOverflow answers, but in the end, you are getting a stable software which is way easier to maintain and add features&nbsp;to.</p><h4>Egor</h4><p>I switched to Reason when I joined Ahrefs team about a year ago, before that I worked mostly with Ruby language.</p><p>The first thing that impressed me in ReasonML was code refactoring. Refactoring in language with a strong type system, like ReasonML and OCaml, is much easier than what I am used to. If your program compiles after your refactoring&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;most likely you did everything right, if it doesn&rsquo;t compile&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;you can immediately see what you forgot to change. This can be achieved in languages with a dynamic type system only with a huge amount of code tests (supporting big test suite is a time consuming process as well as code support).</p><p>The other thing that I really like about ReasonML codebase&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;how readable it is. When you just enter into ReasonML world&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;some things can be unfriendly from the first sight, for example, immutable let bindings, but in the end, you realize that these language decisions help you to write cleaner and simpler&nbsp;code.</p><h4>Seif</h4><p>The programming language I used the most in the past is JavaScript. I switched to Reason when I joined Ahrefs a few months ago. From the start, I worked mainly on the code shared by the majority of the tools and I don&rsquo;t think I would have had the same confidence making changes if I was doing it with JavaScript. I love JavaScript&rsquo;s developer experience and accessibility. Reason provided me predictability without hurting these very same things I like about JavaScript.</p><h4>Bryan</h4><p>Reason (and OCaml) is, by far, one of the easiest languages to work with. Easy in the sense that the compiler helps eliminate an entire class of errors so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about them. Additionally, in most other web-centric languages, it&rsquo;s a pain to add features to existing code that you&rsquo;ve not touched for a long time. With strong static typing, I can usually add the feature I want in either the backend or frontend, and then let the compiler tell me what needs to be&nbsp;updated.</p><p>Pattern-matching is one of my favourite features in Reason. To me, it makes more sense to be able to explicitly specify conditions that I&rsquo;m interested in a clear and concise manner, and let the compiler tell me if I missed out a particular condition. Records go hand-in-hand with this. As software programs are made up of data and instructions, records are the perfect data containers. They are quick to define and query, focusing on data rather than behaviour (think classes and instance methods).</p><p>It definitely took a while to pick up Reason mainly because it takes time to become familiar with idiomatic OCaml. But once I crested that learning curve, everything just made sense and all the features of the language that made Reason seemingly difficult to learn&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;strong typing, the functional paradigm, etc, became assistants that helped me to write better&nbsp;code.</p><h4>Feihong</h4><p><a href="https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/">ReasonReact</a> is a great library for making complex UIs in a large codebase because you get the familiarity of React coupled with the type safety of OCaml. Having two well-established technologies in its foundation is a big advantage that ReasonReact has over other functional UI libraries/frameworks in the transpile-to-JS universe. I didn&rsquo;t have any professional OCaml experience before joining, yet the ramp up was made much easier by my existing knowledge of React and the (somewhat superficial) similarity of the Reason syntax to JS. Oftentimes it was possible to correctly guess the intent of existing Reason code without knowing all the syntax, because most React concepts carry over pretty directly. And even though the documentation is incomplete and not perfect, it&rsquo;s quite usable already and among conceptually-similar frameworks is second only to the Elm documentation.</p><p>The compiler errors were difficult to get used to at first. The compiler is fairly good at pointing out the location of the error, but not necessarily as good at explaining the nature or cause of the error. As such, having a REPL would be extremely useful. Actually, OCaml does have its own REPL, but BuckleScript (the compiler used by Reason to translate OCaml to JS) does not at the moment. Nonetheless, the <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/en/try">Try Reason</a> page is a really good tool to try out small snippets of code and is extremely useful while learning the language (we will still occasionally post Try Reason links in our slack channel).</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>The reality is that Ahrefs has always been an OCaml shop, but in the past OCaml was only used to build the backend. Now that we are also using it on the frontend, we get the benefits that our backend colleagues have enjoyed for many years: the expressiveness afforded by pattern matching, the ease of refactoring in large codebases, the stability of a mature programming language, and the confidence of &ldquo;if it compiles, it works&rdquo;. To make a shoddy nautical analogy, it is as if we had built a wooden ship powered by a turbo engine. But now the wooden parts are being replaced with steel and plastic, bringing the exterior of the ship up to modern standards as well. As a result, the ship runs faster and more reliably, making the passengers (our users) more satisfied. Also, pirates (bugs) have a harder time hijacking the ship because it&rsquo;s sturdier and defended by well-disciplined camels. Because the ship keeps getting more and more passengers who want to experience a delightful ride and take pictures with enigmatic camels, we require a constant influx of willing and able boat engineers (who aren&rsquo;t allergic to camels) to extend and maintain the ship. (Yes, that means that <a href="https://ahrefs.com/jobs">we are hiring</a>&#65039;.)</p><p><em>Thanks to Raman and Louis for fact checking this&nbsp;post.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2250cf5ba63b" width="1" height="1" alt=""/><hr/><p><a href="https://tech.ahrefs.com/one-and-a-half-years-of-reasonml-in-production-2250cf5ba63b">One and a half years of ReasonML in production</a> was originally published in <a href="https://tech.ahrefs.com">Ahrefs</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
