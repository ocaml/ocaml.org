<h3>Intro</h3><p>There has never been a better time to learn OCaml, one of the premier statically-typed functional programming languages used in industry. We at Ahrefs have used it on our backend since the early days of the company, and <a href="https://tech.ahrefs.com/one-and-a-half-years-of-reasonml-in-production-2250cf5ba63b">since 2018 have even used it extensively for our frontend code</a>. Today we&rsquo;re very excited to share with you our favorite recommendations for getting started with&nbsp;OCaml!</p><h3>Best resources for learning&nbsp;OCaml</h3><p>If you have little functional programming experience or are even a beginner to programming, the place to start is <a href="https://ocaml-book.com/">OCaml from the Very Beginning</a>, a book that is now free thanks to generous funding from the <a href="https://ocaml-sf.org/">OCaml Software Foundation</a> (which Ahrefs is a sponsor of). The book can be viewed directly from its website and can also be downloaded as a PDF. While advertised as being approachable even to new programmers, this doesn&rsquo;t quite seem to be true, at least based on feedback we&rsquo;ve received. The text itself introduces concepts in a structured way, but the exercises require a little background in programming to complete. Such background info can be obtained by watching the opening videos in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLre5AT9JnKShBOPeuiD9b-I4XROIJhkIU">this series of lectures</a> from Cornell&rsquo;s OCaml programming course. Speaking of the Cornell course, their official online textbook <a href="https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html">OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful</a> is an excellent resource for learners with some programming experience under their belt (specifically, you should have written some code using a mainstream imperative language like Python or&nbsp;Java).</p><h3>How to install&nbsp;OCaml</h3><p>The <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running">official installation instructions</a> are entirely adequate. It shows you how to install the compiler and some useful dev tools like dune (build system), utop (interactive read-eval-print loop), and ocaml-lsp-server (useful for editor integration).</p><p>Actually, if you are working through <a href="https://ocaml-book.com/">OCaml from the Very Beginning</a>, you do not need to install OCaml during the first several chapters, as you can execute code snippets directly on the <a href="https://try.ocamlpro.com/">Try OCaml</a> page, or create a notebook at <a href="https://sketch.sh/">Sketch.sh</a>, an interactive OCaml notebook site maintained by Ahrefs through our monthly Open Source Friday&nbsp;program.</p><h3>Editor support</h3><p>For most beginners to the language, we recommend the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform">official OCaml Platform Visual Studio Code extension</a>. The official OCaml installation guide has a <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running#editor-support-for-ocaml">good section on setting it up</a>. There is also great support for users of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg">emacs</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/vim-ocaml">vim</a>.</p><h3>Tips</h3><p>Even early on, it&rsquo;s a good idea to start saving your code into&nbsp;.ml files and learning how to run it. The easiest way to run a simple program is to start up utop and inside of it run #use &quot;name_of_your_program.ml&quot; as <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/first-hour#running-ocaml-programs">described here</a>.</p><p>When creating a new notebook in <a href="https://sketch.sh/">Sketch.sh</a>, the default syntax is ReasonML (it&rsquo;s not a different language, just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(programming_language)">an alternate syntax that more resembles JavaScript</a>). Click on ML in the top left corner to switch to the original OCaml&nbsp;syntax.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EgPCQlLR4C54N3Ge" alt=""/></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>OCaml originated from French academia more than 25 years ago, and from there spread to elite universities and forward-thinking companies around the world. Now the OCaml community has produced high quality learning material that is both free and easy to access. So take the initiative and learn you some&nbsp;OCaml!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2f22b578b984" width="1" height="1" alt=""/><hr/><p><a href="https://tech.ahrefs.com/how-to-get-started-with-ocaml-in-2022-2f22b578b984">How to get started with OCaml in 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://tech.ahrefs.com">Ahrefs</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
