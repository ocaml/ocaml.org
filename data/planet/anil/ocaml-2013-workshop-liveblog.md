<p>I attended the OCaml 2013 workshop and took live notes of the event. There was a lot going on here, which you can learn more about in the "<a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/the-year-in-ocamllabs">Reviewing the first year of OCaml Labs in 2013</a>" roundup as well that I published later in the year.</p>
