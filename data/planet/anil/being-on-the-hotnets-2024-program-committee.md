<p>I was on the program committee for <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2024/">HotNets
2024</a> this year, which was a
thoroughly enjoyable experience. The <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2024/accepted.html">list of accepted
papers</a> is now out,
and it's a diverse program -- with my personal favourites being the ones on
space communications networks using low earth orbit satellites.</p>
<p>Well done to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/bearzani/">Behnaz
Arzani</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/">Nate
Foster</a> for really excellent general
chairing and ensuring the PC maintained a constructive, positive tone while
doing the difficult job of selecting papers from a crowded set of submissions.
The structure of of the program committee was also somewhat novel, and one
I'd like to replicate in other conferences I organise in the future.</p>

<li><strong>Two Review Rounds.</strong> There were two rounds of reviewing, with any clear decisions from the first
set of reviewers resulting in an early rejection decision. Remaining papers
went through to round 2, where they got a further set of reviews.</li>
<li><strong>HotCRP Discussions.</strong> The PC strove to discuss the papers on <a href="https://hotcrp.com">HotCRP</a> before
the in-person PC meeting, coming to consensus on a number of them. Only a
small subset of the full papers had to be discussed in the live meeting.  HotCRP has
superb support to facilitate this sort of interaction, in a way that alternatives
like EasyChair simply don't. I'm <em>much</em> more likely to agree to future program
committees if they use HotCRP.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Meeting with Pods.</strong> For the live meeting, the chairs organised "pods" at Microsoft in Seattle (with Behnaz)
and at Jane Street in New York (with Nate). I was hoping to host a pod in
Cambridge as well, but I ended up having to travel to New York for some
meetings on biodiversity and so went along to the Jane Street pod.
This was wonderful -- we got to minimise travel, and yet have good synchronous
discussions, with excellent A/V links between the pods.  Other PC members
got to Zoom in as usual if they couldn't make it to a pod, but there was
enough critical mass to make it a more social occasion for those who did attend
one.</li>
<li><strong>Post PC Workshop.</strong> There was an excellent workshop of talks held afterwards, where I spoke on
planetary computing, and I got to hear the legendary <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-nigito-a366052/">Brian Nigito</a>
talk about their low latency <a href="https://x.com/yminsky/status/1837650874409136339">TCP/IP stack called NetKit</a>
that's written in OCaml.  Now, I've <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip">written an OCaml TCP/IP stack</a>
or two in my time, but what makes theirs really exciting is that it takes advantage
of the experimental modal types in their <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/author/mslater/">"oxidised" OCaml</a>
branch be as performance as a non-garbage-collected stack. I sadly had to run
for my flight back home half-way through the workshop, but it was lovely to
reconnect with the networking community again after being deep into environmental
science for the past few years.</li>

<p>I'm noting down the HotNets as a potentially really good way to run the next
<a href="https://propl.dev">Programming for the Planet</a>, which is due in 2025. More
news on that soon!  In the meanwhile, get your papers into <a href="https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/loco/loco2024/">LOCO
2024</a> which is due in a couple of
days...</p>
