<p>I was honoured to be included in the OCaml team that won the <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/acm-programming-languages-software-award-goes-ocaml-researchers">ACM Programming Languages Software Award for 2023</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the world's largest association of computing professionals, today gave the 2023 SIGPLAN Award to a group of developers for their work on the functional programming language OCaml.</p>
<p>The award was presented at the annual SIGPLAN Programming Language Design and Implementation Conference to a group of researchers and developers including our colleague Anil Madhavapeddy, Professor of Planetary Computing here.</p>
<p>The prestigious Programming Languages Software Award is given annually "to an institution or individual(s) to recognise the development of a software system that has had a significant impact on programming language research, implementations, and tools," ACM says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The OCaml Compiler Distribution is the reference implementation of the OCaml language, a dialect of ML that aims to be pragmatic, both in language features and implementation, encouraging a simple programming style that yields good performance and usability. It has a large user base in industry, research, and education throughout the world, and was used to implement a number of other impactful systems, notably in verification: Coq proof assistant, CompCert verified compiler, Why3 verified programming environment, Frama-C, Astr√©e and Gillian static analyzers, Infer, Hack and Flow projects at Meta, SLAM/SDV and F* at Microsoft, etc.
