title: Generating a corpus of Hazel programs from ill-typed OCaml programs
description: 'The Workshop on Type-Driven Development (TyDe) aims to show how static
  type information may be used effectively in the development of computer programs.
  Co-located with ICFP, this workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners
  who are using or exploring types as a means of program development.

  We welcome all contributions, both theoretical and practical, on a range of topics
  including:


  dependently typed programming;

  generic programming;

  design and implementation of programming languages, exploiting types in novel ways;

  exploiting typed data, data dependent data, or type pr ...'
