<p>Managing package manager constraints is getting difficult, particularly given the growth of the number of packages in the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">opam repository</a>. I'm therefore laying out a new mechanism for the OCaml contributors to submit large package sets, such as those from <a href="https://janestreet.com">Jane Street</a>.</p>
