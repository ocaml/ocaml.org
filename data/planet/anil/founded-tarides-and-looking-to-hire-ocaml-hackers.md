<p>I'm delighted to report that I'm helping my long-time collaborator <a href="https://github.com/samoht" class="contact">Thomas Gazagnaire</a> to return to his OCaml roots from Docker. He has just founded Tarides, a startup in Paris with the goal of advancing the open source OCaml ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Founded in Paris in early 2018, Tarides helps developers and companies build secure, performant and resource-efficient network and storage services. We are using MirageOS to run applications without the overhead of a traditional operating system and Irmin to create scalable distributed applications. Tarides offers commercial support and commercial development services for companies interested to run MirageOS or Irmin as part of their technology stack.
