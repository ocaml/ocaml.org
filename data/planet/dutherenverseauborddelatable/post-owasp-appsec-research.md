<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just back from the <a href="http://maps.google.fr/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=fr&amp;geocode=&amp;q=valhallav%C3%A4gen,%20stockholm,%20sweden&amp;sll=59.341703,18.085642&amp;sspn=0.011554,0.038581&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Valhallav%C3%A4gen,%20Stockholm,%20Su%C3%A8de&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=59.342492,18.082905&amp;panoid=eR1USBvCpPGSpsXEMaH3cg&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,5">Way to Valhalla</a> and <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Research_2010_-_Stockholm,_Sweden">OWASP AppSec Research 2010</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The welcome was great, with plenty of people interested in <a href="http://www.mlstate.com">OPA</a> &mdash; some of them actually looking enthusiastic. I was quite surprised to realize that a number of researchers, developers and consultants in the web security community are very much aware of the limitations of current-generation approaches to security, but just don&rsquo;t have the resources to start working on a next-generation approach. Speaking of resources, we&rsquo;re now getting close to being 7 years into the OPA project, a commitment that not many research groups or companies could make.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Interestingly, during his talk, Dave Wichers, the editor for the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks</a> project, mentioned that the solution was certainly to <em>switch language and paradigm</em>, to something cleaner and easier to secure. This is, of course, exactly what we have been working on during all these years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the slides and videos of the conference should be uploaded soon on the official website. In the meantime, I have uploaded <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/IamYoric/opa-owasp-2010">my slides</a>. I&rsquo;ll try and add some sound if I can work out some sound problems I&rsquo;ve been encountering recently with my presentations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Edit</strong> The presentation of OPA <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/opabymlstate">available on Dailymotion</a> had sound issues. I&rsquo;ve finally managed to fix them. Enjoy!</p>
