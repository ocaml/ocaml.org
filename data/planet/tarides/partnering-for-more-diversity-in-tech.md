<p>Tarides is very glad to announce our partnership with <a href="https://adatechschool.fr">Ada Tech
School</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 and based in Paris (France), Ada Tech School, named for pioneer
computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>,
is a programming school designed for women but open to all. The program is
driven by three values: feminism, empathy and singularity. Its mission is to
facilitate access to programming positions and promote the feminization of tech,
by creating training that tackles the gender and cultural biases of IT.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the diversity of the candidate pool is very limited when a
company tries to fill positions. Barely 10% of computer science students in
France are girls. Ada Tech School is an excellent initiative to democratize
software education amongst women. The school was created so that women can land
a job easily in the IT industry through rigorous training, and then offer
ongoing coaching and support to ascend the professional ladder within tech
companies.</p>
<p>At Tarides, we believe that a healthy team is a diverse one; and that trust,
fairness and inclusion are values needed to build a strong company.</p>
<p>We are committed to doing better, not only by hiring a diverse team and
providing a welcoming work environment, but also by putting people first at
every stage. This means providing fair and equitable compensation as well as
meaningful career advancement opportunities for every employee.</p>
<p>We believe that a great technology always derives from great people, regardless
of their background. Head <a href="https://tarides.com/company">here</a> to see our
currently-open positions.</p>
