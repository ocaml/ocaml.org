<p>Tarides engineer Zach Shipko answers a few questions about why he decided to learn OCaml and why he's particularly excited about the OCaml 5 release. In celebration of OCaml 5, we've interviewed several engineers about their personal experience with the language and what features they enjoy. It's a great way to get some unique insight into the language from someone who works with it on a daily basis.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Christine: Why did you decide to become an OCaml programmer rather than Python or C++?</strong></p>
<p>Zach: I don't really see myself as an &quot;OCaml programmer&quot; because I use Python, C, Rust, Javascript, and other languages quite frequently. It's my interest in many different programming languages that led me to OCaml!</p>
<p><strong>C: What do you like best in OCaml?</strong></p>
<p>Z: One of my favorite things about OCaml is the amount of thought put into new language features. Because of this I think the whole community values the importance of API design and correctness.</p>
<p><strong>C: What&rsquo;s the coolest thing you've made with OCaml?</strong></p>
<p>Z: I have been working on <a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/main/libirmin.opam"><code>libirmin</code></a>, which provides C bindings to the Irmin API, making it possible to use Irmin directly from C and other languages. This uses <a href="https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-ctypes/tree/master/src/cstubs"><code>Cstubs_inverted</code></a> to wrap OCaml code in C functions. I don't know how &quot;cool&quot; that is, but everytime it works I am pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p><strong>C: Why should engineers learn OCaml?</strong></p>
<p>Z: Learning a new programming language can help you see problems from a new perspective and it gives you another tool to reach for when needed. OCaml has lots of nice features (pattern matching, functors, ...) that make solving certain problems more fun.</p>
<p><strong>C: What are you most excited about in OCaml 5?</strong></p>
<p>Z: Other than being able to use multiple cores, I am very excited about Effects (and eventually typed effects). It is an entirely new paradigm for writing applications with a lot of research behind it. To have a usable effects system in a general-purpose language like OCaml is a huge accomplishment!</p>
<hr/>
<p>Zach emphasises the importance of expanding your horizons as a programmer, learning new languages to give you fresh perspectives and insights. Perhaps especially when learning a language like OCaml. Like the esteemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis">Alan Perlis</a> said, &quot;A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.&quot;</p>
<p>Zach also studied photography and digital media in college. He took the pictures at the top of this post and said he &quot;typically picks photos like this to have some nature to look at on programming websites.&quot;</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-12-29-engineer-spotlight-jules-aguillon">Jules Aguillon's</a> interview from 27 December 2022 to learn about his journey to OCaml. Next week, look for our final Engineer Spotlight interview with Sudha Parimala, as well as a post from her on the Benchmarking Game.</p>
