<p>We are steadfast OCaml advocates, <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-06-19-keeping-up-with-the-compiler-how-we-help-maintain-the-ocaml-language/">providing core maintenance</a>, <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-05-01-we-host-our-first-ocaml-retreat-in-india/">hosting community events</a>, and <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2023-03-02-the-journey-to-ocaml-multicore-bringing-big-ideas-to-life/">bringing groundbreaking new features to the language</a>. We choose OCaml because it is a programming language with a unique combination of strengths, combining an expressive syntax and strong type system with memory safety and the power of multicore programming.</p>
<p>OCaml’s success is the combined result of the innovative efforts, passion, and dedication of the people who contribute to its development. The open-source community behind OCaml works collaboratively and transparently to make OCaml faster, safer, and easier. This community is made up of individual developers, research groups, and companies all working together. Tarides is one of the companies that contribute extensively to OCaml, and several of our team members are core OCaml developers.</p>
<p>You can support our open-source work by becoming a sponsor on our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/tarides">GitHub page</a>. Your contribution will have a direct impact on the OCaml ecosystem by helping us maintain, develop, and improve its libraries, features, and tools. Let’s show you what we’re working on and what your support will help us achieve for OCaml!</p>
<h2>What Does Tarides do?</h2>
<p>At Tarides, we’re passionate about making OCaml even more powerful and accessible for developers. Our work focuses on three key areas: Enhancements, maintenance, and accessibility. Your contribution will support our work in all these areas.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enhancing the Language: We bring new features to OCaml by resolving developer pain points and testing performance on different platforms. We want OCaml to be a competitive programming language with developer experience a high priority.</li>
<li>Maintaining Core Tools and Libraries: We ensure that OCaml developers have a reliable foundation for their projects by keeping the tools and libraries they depend on up to date.</li>
<li>Community Support and Outreach: We prioritise clear documentation and tutorials to improve accessibility and regularly organise events that allow community members to meet and exchange ideas.</li>
</ol>
