<p>We are thrilled to announce that our sister company, <a href="https://parsimoni.co/">Parsimoni</a>, is part of <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/meet-the-startups-joining-techstars-fall-2025-accelerator-programs">Techstars’</a> autumn 2025 space accelerator programme in Los Angeles! They are in great company, with 4 other very synergistic space startups <a href="https://www.ant61.com/beacon">ANT61</a>, <a href="https://www.azora.space/">Azora</a>, <a href="https://cisgam.com/">CISGAM</a>, and <a href="https://www.translunar-esi.com/">Translunar Exports and Servicing Incorporated</a>.</p>
<p>Kick off was on the 8th of September. For the next 3 months, Parsimoni will benefit from Techstars’ mentorship, network, and investment to drive their mission of making satellite-based resources accessible to all.</p>
<h2>Parsimoni’s SpaceOS</h2>
<p>Parsimoni is developing SpaceOS, a next-generation operating system tailored to satellites and their payloads. By using unikernel technology (see <a href="https://mirageos.org/">MirageOS</a> for another example), the size of each application is optimised to its minimal viable state, reducing the attack size and improving performance. The resulting efficiency is valuable for users – reducing costs, extending mission capabilities, and allowing for more advanced processing in orbit – and also better for the planet. More efficient, multi-purpose satellites make better use of limited resources and create new possibilities for the satellite industry.</p>
<p>These advantages, along with its security-by-design approach (including PQC) and high adaptability to new features and applications, make SpaceOS the perfect candidate for use cases like AI-powered earth observation, secure mission operations, and next-generation space marketplaces.</p>
<p>Parsimoni uses <a href="https://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> to build their software, benefitting from the language's <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2023-12-14-ocaml-memory-safety-and-beyond/">security guarantees</a>, and this approach is garnering attention from a world-leading accelerator. It illustrates how Tarides' mission of building mission-critical systems in OCaml is a recipe for success – in the FinTech sector, space sector, and beyond!

<h2>Techstars</h2>
