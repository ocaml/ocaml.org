<p>Today I am incredibly delighted to announce that <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/projects/ocamllabs">OCaml
Labs</a>, a spinout from the
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, is joining
<a href="https://tarides.com/">Tarides</a>. After successfully collaborating on
many OCaml projects over the last four years, this alliance will
combine the expertise of both groups and enable us to bring OCaml, one
of the most advanced programming languages in the world, into
mainstream use. Combining forces will accelerate OCaml development and
its broader adoption. Furthermore, it will bring the security,
portability, and performance of OCaml to a large spectrum of
use-cases: from academic endeavours, such as formal methods and
existing threats within cyber-security, to real-world applications for
climate change, sustainable agriculture, and even space exploration!</p>
<p>All of OCaml Labs&rsquo; existing responsibilities and open-source
commitments will migrate over to Tarides, and thanks to how closely
the teams already work, business will continue without interruption to
continuity or delivery. Gemma Gordon will step up as CEO of Tarides,
and I will continue to lead the technological vision and strategy as
CTO. As Prof. Anil Madhavapeddy, founder of OCaml Labs and scientific
advisor of Tarides, points out, &ldquo;The cutting edge research we
conducted at the University over the past decade has now migrated into
mainline OCaml, and so the ongoing curation and development will now
happen on a commercially supported basis. I&rsquo;m excited to continue
collaborating on research with Tarides from the University of
Cambridge.&rdquo; Tarides will continue the work started at OCaml Labs and
invest in the growth, health, and development of OCaml alongside its
wider use-cases.</p>
<p>I am honoured to have the incredible OCaml Labs team - the team who
carefully designed and crafted <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly">Multicore OCaml</a> - join Tarides. We
share a similar view that a common plague affects the ever-growing
software industry, namely the bad quality of software and the
omnipresence of bugs. However, this is not a fatal flaw. Tools
developed by OCaml Labs over the years do not compromise on quality,
and they allow dev teams to automatically fix at least 70% of
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/18/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/">security
bugs</a>
and <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/0day.html">0-days security
exploits</a>. Consequently,
OCaml is a simple yet powerful language that can respond to the many
challenges developers face today. Since Tarides&rsquo;s inception, we have
envisioned a future where all OCaml applications are easily deployable
as specialised, secure, and energy-efficient
<a href="https://mirage.io">MirageOS</a> unikernels. This alliance is a step
further in that direction. Since OCaml is the language used to develop
MirageOS, Tarides has continuously developed and maintained parts of
the OCaml ecosystem since its creation. Our alliance with OCaml Labs
makes this more evident. The MirageOS ecosystem critically depends on
OCaml, and the OCaml ecosystem benefits from innovations coming from
the MirageOS project. Tarides is therefore fully committed to making
the synergy between OCaml and MirageOS a success.</p>
<p>Several exciting projects related to Multicore OCaml are coming to a
head this year. The OCaml 5.0 release will support multicore and
effects handlers, influencing every aspect of the language and its
ecosystem. The update will significantly improve both performance and
user experience whilst maintaining existing features that make OCaml
the language of choice for building, for instance, verification
software tools. Using the teams&rsquo; combined experience and zest for
innovation, Tarides is looking to the future of the OCaml language and
community with excitement. We will continue to push the boundaries of
exploration whilst focusing on what's good for the
community. <strong>Therefore, this alliance will complement the commercial
offering of Tarides and contribute to Tarides' mission: empowering
developers, communities and organisations to adopt OCaml as their
primary programming experience by providing training, expertise, and
development services around the OCaml language.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to be part of an organisation innovating in many
areas around operating systems, distributed systems, and security with
the <a href="https://irmin.org">Irmin</a> distributed store and the MirageOS
unikernel projects,&rdquo; says Gemma Gordon, CEO of Tarides. &ldquo;I am
incredibly proud of the people OCaml Labs has collaborated with. We
have been able to build a sustainable open-source community, with
people from various backgrounds all collaborating together. It used to
be that people would have to volunteer their time on OCaml, or work in
academic research. We have created an additional funded path, one that
has increased the diversity and innovation of our community. I&rsquo;m
excited to continue to be part of a group that brings the best minds
together to solve the many problems the software industry faces
today. I look forward to building a flourishing and sustainable
commercial business with existing Tarides partners as well as
developing new collaborative opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This alliance brings the headcount of Tarides up to 60+ people, all
working towards making OCaml the best language for any and every
project. Join our team: <a href="https://tarides.com/company">https://tarides.com/company</a></p>

<p><em>OCaml Labs has been at the forefront of innovation in OCaml for
nearly a decade. It was founded at the University of Cambridge by
Prof. Anil Madhavapeddy in 2012 and developed into a spin-out
consultancy company in 2016. OCaml Labs' mission was to push OCaml and
functional programming forward as a platform, making it a more
effective tool for all users (including large-scale industrial
deployments) while at the same time growing the appeal of the language
to broaden its applicability and popularity.</em></p>
<p><em>OCaml Labs has been instrumental in developing and maintaining the
OCaml platform for OCaml usage at an industrial scale. OCaml Labs
contributed to the development and maintenance of the
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/">opam</a> package management
ecosystem and of the OCaml community website, <a href="https://ocaml.org/">https://ocaml.org/</a>,
first launched in 2012. These sites act as hubs for the OCaml community
to showcase the state-of-the-art and facilitate innovation. A new and
improved version of the site has been <a href="https://v3.ocaml.org/">released under
beta</a> this month. In addition, OCaml Labs' most
significant (and technically complex) project, OCaml Multicore, will
finally come to fruition this year. Work on this project began in
2014, followed by award-winning papers and presentations in 2020 and
the announcement in late 2021 that Multicore will become part of the
mainline OCaml compiler.</em></p>
