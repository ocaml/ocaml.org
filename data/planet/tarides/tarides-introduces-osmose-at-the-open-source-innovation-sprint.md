<p>Tarides is excited to announce that our CEO, Dr. Thomas Gazagnaire, and Prof.
Anil Madhavapeddy, from the University of Cambridge, will present their
innovative platform OSMOSE at the Open Source Innovation Sprint (OSIS)
conference on 1 July 2021. This event is organized by
<a href="https://systematic-paris-region.org">Systematic</a>.</p>
<p>OSMOSE is a software platform made to manage digital infrastructure at scale,
securely and efficiently. It uses the groundbreaking creation of unikernels to
radically simplify the way applications are built and deployed for the cloud.</p>
<p>Since digital transformation has become more and more dependent on cloud
computing, it has increasing problems with high response latency, security
risks, and resource inefficiencies&mdash;all which make these services ultimately
unreliable. The demand for interconnected devices is ever increasing, but the
security of these devices remain unchecked, making them susceptible to security
vulnerabilities. This leaves consumers and businesses open to exploitation, as
demonstrated in reports of tech devices violating users&rsquo; privacy, like sending
audio recordings without their knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>Tarides addresses these issues with OSMOSE, a platform which combines hardware
and software elements to invert the current cloud-centric model. OSMOSE securely
connects with physical spaces to provide extremely low latency and
high-bandwidth, local-area computation capabilities, which can turn a fleet of
IoT devices into a local data-centre.</p>
<p>This innovative platform enables computer resources to be tracked efficiently
and temporarily rented to users. This turns any IoT deployment into a local,
private cloud, allowing a better utilization of local resources and improved
security.</p>
<p>Major components of OSMOSE already have commercial applications. It&rsquo;s been used
to make existing cloud deployments more secure and efficient by companies such
as Amazon, Citrix, and Docker.</p>
<p>Tarides applies a high-touch, mixed business strategy&mdash;using consultancy services
to field test open source components under development. Tarides applies their
research to real-world systems to build unikernels, a secure-by-design and
resource-efficient application specialised to their run-time environments. If
