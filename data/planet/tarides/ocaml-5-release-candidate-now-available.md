<p>We're in the home stretch for the full OCaml 5 release. Multicore is almost here! Yesterday its Release Candidate (RC) was announced on the <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/first-release-candidate-for-ocaml-5-0-0/10922">OCaml Discuss</a>, which is the final step before the major release, expected before Christmas.</p>
<p>To learn more about the exciting features coming with OCaml 5, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ4G0TKwzVc">KC&rsquo;s keynote address</a> and check out his <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kayceesrk/retrofitting-concurrency-lessons-from-the-engine-room">speaker slide deck</a> as well. As always, feel free to <a href="https://tarides.com/company">contact us</a> for more information about using OCaml and for support on your OCaml projects.</p>
<p>The OCaml community has worked tirelessly to release 5.0 before the end of the year, with a lot of time spent on creating a smooth transition for OCaml users. There should be just enough time for you to try out OCaml 5 for a fun holiday project or the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-11-24-solve-the-2022-advent-of-code-puzzles-with-ocaml">Advent of Code</a>.</p>
