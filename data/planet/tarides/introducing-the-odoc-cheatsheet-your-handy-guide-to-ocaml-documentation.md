<p>For developers diving into the OCaml ecosystem, one of the essential tools you'll encounter is <code>odoc</code>. Whether you're a seasoned OCaml programmer or just starting out, understanding how to generate and navigate documentation efficiently is crucial. This is where <code>odoc</code> comes in, OCaml's official documentation generator. To make your experience with <code>odoc</code> even smoother, the <code>odoc</code> team has created the <code>odoc</code> Cheatsheet.</p>

<p><code>odoc</code> is a <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-01-10-meet-odoc-ocaml-s-documentation-generator/">powerful documentation generator</a> specifically designed for the OCaml programming language. It transforms OCaml interfaces, libraries, and packages into clean, readable HTML, LaTex, or man pages. If you've worked with JavaDoc or Doxygen in other programming languages, you'll find <code>odoc</code> to be a similarly indispensable tool in the OCaml world.</p>
<p>The purpose of <code>odoc</code> is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>It helps developers create comprehensive documentation for their projects.</li>
<li>It allows users to easily navigate and understand these projects through a standardised format.</li>
</ol>
<p>As OCaml projects grow in complexity, well-maintained documentation becomes increasingly important for collaboration, onboarding new team members, and ensuring long-term project sustainability.</p>

<p>While <code>odoc</code> is great for generating docs, it uses a syntax that is not widely known. Learning a new syntax can be cumbersome, if not downright difficult. Before this cheatsheet, the resource for the syntax was only in <a href="https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/odoc_for_authors.html">the <code>odoc</code> for Authors page</a>. However, this page offers extensive detail, covering far more than just the syntax. While excellent for in-depth exploration, it can be challenging when you're aiming for quick productivity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/cheatsheet.html"><code>odoc</code> Cheatsheet</a> is a very simple resource for writing simple things. It is easy to read it and discover syntax, and you can use it to recheck your syntax. Rather than explaining, it provides examples, which is less cognitive overhead for the developer. It serves as a concise reference guide that covers the most important aspects of <code>odoc</code>, helping you to quickly get up to speed without wading through extensive documentation.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at how this cheatsheet benefits you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Easy Access to Essential <code>odoc</code> Syntax</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The cheatsheet provides a useful list of <code>odoc</code> syntax. Whether you need to generate documentation for a single module or an entire project, the cheatsheet lays out the exact markup commands you need. This can save a lot of time, as you won’t have to search through various resources to find the correct syntax or options.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Concise and Well-Organised Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Information is presented in a clear, concise table that allows you to quickly find what you need.</p>
<p>This organisation is particularly beneficial when you’re in the middle of coding and need to find a markup command quickly. The cheatsheet gives you instant access to the most relevant information.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>A Great Learning Tool for New OCaml Developers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For those new to OCaml, the <code>odoc</code> Cheatsheet doubles as a learning tool. By following the syntax provided, you’ll not only generate better documentation but also gain a deeper understanding of how to structure your code and its corresponding documentation effectively.</p>
<p>The cheatsheet explains how to use specific annotations in your comments to generate informative documentation. This might not be immediately obvious to someone new to OCaml or <code>odoc</code>, but it can greatly enhance the usability of your generated docs.</p>
