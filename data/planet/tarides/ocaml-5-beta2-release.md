<p>Just about a month after the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-10-17-ocaml-5-beta-release">OCaml 5 Beta release</a>, the OCaml 5 Beta2 version has been released, taking us one step closer to the full OCaml 5 with Multicore release later this year.

<p>Thanks to the hard work by all engineers working to make OCaml even better than before. It's a beautiful sight to watch brilliant developers come together on an open-source project like OCaml, and Tarides is proud to be part of this ever-growing community.</p>
