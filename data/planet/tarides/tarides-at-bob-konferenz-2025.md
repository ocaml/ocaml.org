<p><a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/en/">BOB Konferenz</a> is a 10-year-old
conference whose tagline is: "<strong>The software development
conference for everyone dissatisfied with the status quo</strong>"! Indeed,
BOB is a conference that focusses on a variety of subjects that
strongly converge with the interests of Tarides (and the OCaml world
in general). It aims to cover topics such as functional programming,
"<em>fancy types</em>" (dependent types, gradual typing, linear types, ...),
formal methods for correctness and robustness, abstractions for
concurrency and parallelism, controlled side effects, next-generation
IDEs, and <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/en/cfc.html">much more</a>!</p>
<p>The convergence has been so strong that, over the years, some big
names from the OCaml community have shown up — like <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/">Anil
Madhavapeddy</a>, <a href="https://hannes.robur.coop/">Hannes
Mehnert</a>, <a href="https://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/">Gabriel
Scherer</a>, and even <a href="https://xavierleroy.org/">Xavier
Leroy</a>! This is one of the many reasons why
Tarides decided to sponsor the <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2024/en/">2024
edition</a> and send <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sabine.sh">Sabine
Schmaltz</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leostera.com">Leandro
Ostera</a>.</p>
<p>For the 2025 edition, March 14, 2025, in Berlin, <a href="https://xvw.lol">Xavier Van de
Woestyne</a> had the privilege of presenting Tarides’
work on editor support for OCaml during his talk "<a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/woestyne.html"><em>Beyond the Basics
of LSP: Advanced IDE Services for
OCaml.</em></a>" Accompanied by
<a href="https://github.com/MisterDA">Antonin Decimo</a>, who attended the
conference, Xavier travelled to BOBKonf 2025 to share <em>their insights and
experience</em>.</p>
<h2>A Wide Range of Interesting Talks</h2>
<p>The BOB program is <strong>wonderfully eclectic</strong>, and every talk is an
opportunity to discover something new! For example, after a keynote on
<a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/bieniusa.html">Local-First software</a> — which
included many fascinating use cases with potential applications for
<a href="https://irmin.org/">Irmin</a>. We had the chance to attend talks on
<a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/loeh.html">abstraction</a>, speculative
reasoning about functions based on their types (for instance, a
function of type <code>a -&gt; a</code> having only one possible inhabitant), the
application of <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/allais.html">separation logic for concurrency in
Idris</a>, and even collaborations
between engineers and mathematicians on <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/bailly.html">the specification of formal
methods</a>.</p>
<p>We explored the <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/sperber.html">functional programming counterpart to design
patterns</a> — with a strong
emphasis on <strong>the power of robust module systems</strong>, something that
deeply resonates with us as OCaml developers. That was followed by a
deep reflection on <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/thoma.html">object-oriented programming from a functional
programmer’s perspective</a>, a clear
explanation of <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/breitner.html">how recursive definitions work in
Lean</a>, and, to wrap it all up,
a guide to common pitfalls to avoid when building distributed systems
with <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/oerdoeg.html">microservices</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, it was an intense and inspiring day — packed with ideas
that strongly resonated with us. From our perspective, the themes
explored throughout the conference aligned closely with the
ideological and technical choices we’ve made at Tarides, particularly
our commitment to OCaml. But beyond that, many of the talks echoed the
challenges and directions of the projects we actively maintain!</p>
<h2>About our Presentation</h2>
<p>Although the goal of <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/slides/woestyne.pdf">our
presentation</a> (you can watch the recording <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2025/woestyne.html">on BOBKonf's website</a>) was to
discuss OCaml editor support (through
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">Merlin</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp">Ocaml-lsp-server</a>, and its
clients, <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform">Visual Studio
Code</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot">Emacs</a>), we aimed to present
an approach and a set of features that wouldn’t limit our audience to
just OCaml users. Instead, we wanted to spark a conversation with
other IDE users/maintainers to share ideas and implementation
perspectives!</p>
<p>We believe the presentation was well-received, generating some very
interesting questions along with positive conversations about how
some of the ideas we presented could be applied to proof assistants
like <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/">Isabelle</a>,
<a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris2</a>, and
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/what-is-agda.html">Agda</a>.</p>
<p>There was a proposal to combine our efforts to improve the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language
Server
Protocol</a>,
making it even more welcoming for certain functional languages that
leverage interactive features (where the acceptance model is primarily
based on voting). From our perspective, these were excellent and
<strong>motivating</strong> responses!</p>
<h2>Meet and Greet</h2>
<p>Beyond the technical side, one of the great things about conferences
is the chance to meet people—catch up with familiar faces, make new
connections, and have meaningful conversations around topics we’re all
passionate about! From our perspective, even though the schedule is
<em>quite packed</em>, the talk slots are spaced out just enough to let us
catch our breath — but more importantly, to connect and chat with
members of the community. It really helps to foster a friendly, sociable
atmosphere!</p>
<h2>To Conclude</h2>
<p>Attending conferences is an integral part of our work as engineers—for
several important reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping up with the latest in technology and research</li>
<li>Sharing our progress and presenting the work we’ve been doing</li>
<li>Initiating potential collaborations with people driven by similar
goals and motivations.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, it's important — but at conferences like BOB, it’s also a real
pleasure! The talks are truly fascinating (we’re already looking
forward to the video recordings so we can catch up on what we missed),
and the interactions are incredibly motivating for our work. If, like
us, you’re interested in functional programming, fancy types, formal
methods, and many other exciting topics, don’t hesitate to check out
