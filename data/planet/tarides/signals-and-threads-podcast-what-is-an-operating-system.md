<p>November has become MirageOS month! Between the upcoming official MirageOS 4.0 release, making custom Christmas Tree garlands
with <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2021-11-11-mirageos-workshop-working-with-the-raspberry-pi-4">MirageOS on a Raspberry Pi</a>,
and now <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/what-is-an-operating-system">this &quot;What is an Operating System?&quot; podcast</a> (featuring Tarides advisor and core MirageOS maintainer Anil Madhavapeddy), it truly is MirageOS month!</p>

Combined with <a href="https://irmin.org">Irmin</a>, it allows developers to build secure-by-design, offline-first systems and invert
the current cloud-centric model for designing applications to securely connect physical spaces with extremely low latency
and high bandwidth, using local-area computation capabilities.</p>
