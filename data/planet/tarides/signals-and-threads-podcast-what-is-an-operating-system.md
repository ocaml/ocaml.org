<p>November has become MirageOS month! Between the upcoming official MirageOS 4.0 release, making custom Christmas Tree garlands
with <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2021-11-11-mirageos-workshop-working-with-the-raspberry-pi-4">MirageOS on a Raspberry Pi</a>,

and high bandwidth, using local-area computation capabilities.</p>
