<p>In a world that never stops, it's easy to get lost in the hustle and bustle of daily life, often overlooking the importance of maintaining our mental well-being, one of the most vital aspects of our existence. Especially on <a href="https://mentalhealth-uk.org/blog/how-flexible-working-could-tackle-burnout-in-the-workplace/">World Mental Health Day</a>, observed every October 10th, it's crucial to reflect on the significance of mental health both in our personal lives and within the workplace. At Tarides, we understand that true success goes beyond profits and productivity; it's about the well-being of our employees and contractors.</p>

<p>In today's society, mental health is often overlooked, minimised, or stigmatised. Despite its undeniable impact on our daily lives, mental health continues to be a topic shrouded in silence. The consequences of neglecting mental health can be severe, affecting not only individuals but entire organisations. <a href="https://mentalhealth-uk.org/blog/how-flexible-working-could-tackle-burnout-in-the-workplace/">Stress, anxiety, and burnout</a> can lead to decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and a negative work environment.</p>
<p>At Tarides, we strive to be responsible employers, and we recognise the importance of the mental well-being of our staff. By openly addressing mental health, we aim to create a safe workplace that values holistic health, fosters employee well-being, and promotes a healthy work-life balance.</p>

We also offer a competitive holiday allowance as standard and an additional two weeks paid holiday for all employees in August. This is not only extra paid time off, but our entire organisation also takes a well-deserved breather for these two weeks. No emails, no deadlines, no worries about missing out or coming back to a mountain of work. It's a time to truly disconnect and recharge, stress-free.</p>
