<p><em>The tech industry has long struggled with a lack of diversity. This existing imbalance combined with social and educational problems such as early gender bias still tends to prevent lots of people, including women, from entering the field. <em>Girls Can Code</em> aims to help young women learn programming and gain valuable experience working on projects alongside other like minded individuals.</em></p>
<p>Tarides is proud to share that we sponsored a <a href="https://girlscancode.fr"><em>Girls Can Code</em></a> summer camp! Between Aug 22nd and 27th, the camp offered participants a fully-packed week of programming, socialising, and learning.</p>

<p><em>Girls Can Code</em> is an initiative launched by the organisation <a href="https://prologin.org"><em>Prologin</em></a>, hosting summer camps specifically aimed at teaching young women about computer programming. No prior experience is required, and they accept participants from secondary school and up through the equivalent of A-Levels. Attendance is free, since the events are run by students who generously volunteer their time and expertise.</p>
<p>Camps come in two variants: long and short. The long camps last for a week and the short ones for a weekend. The short camps cover less content, but can be organised more frequently. They are always in the form of a practical introduction to computer science, but may focus on special topics. The week-long summer camps start with an introduction to Python and then continue with several tutorials on various topics. Finally, all participants have the chance to complete a personal project on either robotics, video games, or microcontrollers.</p>

<p>At Tarides, we&rsquo;re committed to using our resources to foster diversity and inclusion. Our own goal is to have 50% of our tech roles be filled by women. For that to be a reality, not just at Tarides but everywhere, more women need to feel welcome in the tech space. Sadly, according to this <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/campus/article/2017/12/11/femmes-et-informatique-vingt-ans-de-desamour_5227726_4401467.html">Le Monde article</a>, only 11% of French women chose to pursue IT careers in 2010. A more <a href="https://technation.io/diversity-and-inclusion-in-uk-tech/#executive-summary">recent survey</a> by Tech Nation showed that in the UK, only 26% of the tech workforce is made up by women. While this number is better, there&rsquo;s still a lot of work to be done before women make up 50% of the workforce in tech.</p>
<p><em>Girls Can Code</em> works proactively to inspire a generation of young French women and make a difference in the sector. They have been arranging summer camps since 2014 and have been growing steadily since. We&rsquo;re proud to support their efforts for a more equitable future!</p>
