<p>The <a href="https://oxbridgewomenincs8.wixsite.com/2020">Oxbridge Women in Computer Science
conference</a> is an annual one-day
event hosted by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (UK). The
conference is free and open to everyone from any discipline, regardless of
gender identity. Its purpose is to spotlight the successes of women within
computer science and strengthen the network of women in computer science
within a supportive and friendly environment.</p>
<p>This year, the conference was organised by the University of Cambridge and was
held virtually on December 7th.</p>
<p>Tarides is very glad to sponsor this event as we strongly believe that diversity
and inclusive culture is a key factor in building a competitive and innovative
company. Our employees come from 8 different countries and are 1&frasl;3 women.
Tarides promotes transparency, openness and autonomy, creating a work atmosphere
auspicious for employees to strive in their work, to solve novel, impactful and
technical challenges. By working on open-source projects, a collaboration is
possible with worldwide experts from both academia and industry, encouraging
continuous training and education; in this context, it is very important to have
teams with diverse backgrounds and experience.</p>
<p>The underrepresentation of women in tech, and particularly in computer science,
is not a new problem and gender equality remains a major issue in the corporate
world. By celebrating female computer scientists, as during the Oxbridge Women
in Computer Science Conference, it will hopefully encourage more women to pursue
their interests and careers in the tech field. Head

<p>For the event, we made a short video to experience a day in the life of a
software engineer:</p>
