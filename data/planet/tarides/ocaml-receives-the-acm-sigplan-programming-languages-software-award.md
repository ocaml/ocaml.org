<p><a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> has received one of the most <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Software/">prestigious
awards</a> in the field of programming languages, and we are very
thrilled that four of the award winners are from Tarides. This
represents a huge success for the language, the named maintainers, and
everyone who has worked on improving OCaml. We want to thank everyone
for their hard work and celebrate the award alongside the OCaml
community. Here&rsquo;s to many more years of hacking together!</p>

<p>The ACM special interest group on programming languages,
<a href="https://www.sigplan.org/">SIGPLAN</a>, annually recognises significant
developments in a software system and awards it with the Programming
Languages Software Award. To be selected for this prestigious award, a
software system must have made a significant impact on <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Software/">programming
language research, implementation, and tools</a>.</p>
<p>Previous recipients include <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, the first widely
adopted language for web browsers since JavaScript; and
<a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, one of the few programming languages from academia
that has had a significant impact on the world as well as on
programming languages research.</p>
<p>This year, fourteen developers in the open-source OCaml ecosystem have
been recognised for their contributions to the design and
implementation of the language. <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> is a functional
programming language that combines type and memory safety with
powerful features like garbage collection and a type inferring
compiler. Born out of extensive research into ML, OCaml was first
released in 1996 by Xavier Leroy, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Vouillon, Damien Doligez, and
Didier R&eacute;my. Since then, the open-source community surrounding OCaml
has grown (in parts, thanks to Tarides!) with new tools, libraries,
and applications.</p>
<p><strong>OCaml is unique because it occupies a sweet spot in the space of
programming language designs. It provides a combination of efficiency,
expressiveness and practicality that is matched by no other
language.</strong> This is largely because OCaml is an elegant combination of
language features developed over the last <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/prologue.html">60 years</a>, with strong
roots in academia and the industry. The language also continues to
evolve and innovate, with the release of <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-12-19-ocaml-5-with-multicore-support-is-here/">OCaml 5</a> last
December. That release heralds a new era for OCaml by providing the
infrastructure for programming efficiently and safely using multiple
cores. OCaml 5 also added <a href="https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/effects.html">effect handlers</a> to the language,
which makes OCaml the first mainstream language with support with
effects.  Meanwhile, OCaml is now used for <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/why-ocaml/">trading billions of
dollars in global equity daily</a> or for <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/how-docker-desktop-networking-works-under-the-hood/">helping millions of daily
users of Docker to access the network</a>.</p>
<p>The engineers receiving this award have played a crucial role in
the long-term development of the OCaml language. Their hard work has
made OCaml a language that prioritises performance and expressivity
while strongly focusing on security and safety. The fourteen
developers named by ACM SIGPLAN are: <a href="https://github.com/dra27">David
Allsopp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Octachron/">Florian
Angeletti</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stedolan">Stephen
Dolan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Doligez">Damien Doligez</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alainfrisch">Alain
Frisch</a>, <a href="https://github.com/garrigue">Jacques
Garrigue</a>, <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/">Anil Madhavapeddy</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/maranget">Luc Maranget</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nojb">Nicol&aacute;s Ojeda
B&auml;r</a>, <a href="https://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/">Gabriel Scherer</a>, <a href="https://kcsrk.info/">KC
Sivaramakrishnan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vouillon">J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Vouillon</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/lpw25">Leo White</a> and <a href="https://xavierleroy.org/">Xavier Leroy</a>.</p>
<p>It is well worth noting that Xavier Leroy already holds many
prestigious awards for his work - he is a former recipient of the
ACM SIGPLAN <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Achievement/">Programming Languages Achievement</a> award in 2022,
holds the chair of software science at <a href="https://www.college-de-france.fr/">Coll&egrave;ge de France</a>
and is member of <a href="https://www.academie-sciences.fr/">Acad&eacute;mie des sciences</a>. Xavier made
pivotal contributions across various fields, including the design of
type and module systems, bytecode verification, and verified
compilation, to highlight a few. He is also the visionary architect of
the <a href="https://compcert.org/">CompCert C compiler</a>, the first formally verified,
high-assurance compiler for almost all of the C language. This
enormous achievements generated entirely new areas of activity and
research: CompCert won the 2022 <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Software/">ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages
Software award</a> and the
<a href="https://awards.acm.org/software-system">2021 ACM Software Systems
award</a>. But Xavier's research
contributions are not just integral to his illustrious career. They
are also pivotal to OCaml's current success and widespread appeal. His
active and ongoing influence is deeply embedded within OCaml, shaping
it into the rigorous yet pragmatic language that it is today.</p>

<p>Tarides is honoured to contribute to the development of OCaml and to
be part of the vibrant ecosystem surrounding the language. <em>Four of the
developers receiving the award are affiliated with Tarides: David, KC,
J&eacute;r&ocirc;me and Anil!</em></p>
<p>The list of recipients comprises award-winning and internationally
acclaimed academics (Inria, University of Cambridge, University of
Nagoya, IIT Madras) as well as impactful and innovative industry
professionals (Lexifi, Jane Street, Tarides). This list makes a
compelling case for the model that guides the entire OCaml ecosystem
and that we&rsquo;ve adopted at Tarides. We combine the powers of academia,
industry, and community hackers by collaborating for the benefit of
OCaml as a whole.</p>
<p>Moreover, Tarides is a descendant of <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-01-27-ocaml-labs-joins-tarides/">OCaml Labs</a> at the
University of Cambridge, a decade-long effort aiming to bring OCaml to
the masses:KC, Stephen, Leo, and David all started off at the
University of Cambridge, under the direction of <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/projects/ocamllabs/">Anil</a>. Since
then, OCaml Labs and now Tarides have dedicated much time and energy
towards maintaining several parts of the OCaml ecosystem, including
the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-12-19-ocaml-5-with-multicore-support-is-here/">compiler</a>, <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/platform">platform tools</a>, the <a href="https://ocaml.ci.dev/">CI
infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml.org</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to acknowledge that this award
recognises the hard work of people beyond just the list of
winners. There are countless people who have contributed to OCaml, who
taken together would be too numerous to formally
recognise. Nevertheless, their hard work is palpable and their impact
far-reaching, and we want to thank everyone who has played a role in
bringing OCaml to where it is today. This achievement is one we all
share with the entire community.</p>

<p>As described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ4G0TKwzVc">KC's keynote</a>, OCaml 5.0 introduced <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2023-03-02-the-journey-to-ocaml-multicore-bringing-big-ideas-to-life/">much
anticipated new features</a> to OCaml, supporting shared memory
parallelism and effect handlers. The team focused on making that
release as backwards compatible as possible; thus, existing OCaml
users could upgrade without experiencing breakage. OCaml 5 allows
users to combine <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-12-19-ocaml-5-with-multicore-support-is-here/">safety and security features</a> with
significant <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2022-12-20-how-nomadic-labs-used-multicore-processing-to-create-a-faster-blockchain/">performance improvements</a>, including parallel
programming and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio">improved methodologies for writing concurrent
code</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to use the parallelism features in OCaml 5,
