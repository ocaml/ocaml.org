<p>Training your teams has proven benefits, <a href="https://seismic.com/uk/enablement-explainers/the-importance-of-training/">enhancing the efficiency and quality of work</a>, and equipping members with the skills they need to tackle new challenges. Specialist training empowers them to use new techniques, leverage advanced technologies, and solve more complex problems.</p>
<p>At Tarides, we are launching a new initiative to share our expertise and industry experience in a series of customisable, flexible training courses designed to unlock new possibilities for your teams.</p>
<h2>How Tarides Can Help You</h2>
<p>Technical training equips your teams with essential skills to handle the latest software advancements and workflow improvements. While many generic courses exist, specialised knowledge is often necessary, and our targeted training suite offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expert Instructors</strong>: Learn from core developers with years of industry experience</li>
<li><strong>Hands-On Learning</strong>: Jump straight into coding on day one, with exercises and real-world scenarios</li>
<li><strong>Peer Collaboration</strong>: Share knowledge and insights with a community of like-minded developers</li>
<li><strong>Career Advancement</strong>: Acquire new skills to face new challenges</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility &amp; Customisability</strong>: Choose your custom topic elements to ensure the course works best for your needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Our bespoke training can be customised to the unique circumstances of each team, addressing weaknesses and enhancing strengths. Each course offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible sessions: On-site, online, or in a hybrid configuration to fit your schedule</li>

<h2>Our Courses</h2>
<p>We have created a group of courses tailored to different needs, ranging from onboarding a team with OCaml to mastering specialised skills, from basic compliance with cybersecurity guidelines to auditing custom workflows. While they address various applications, all of our training shares a common goal: to minimise friction for busy organisations. Our most popular courses are detailed below:</p>
<h3><a href="https://tarides.com/services/training/">Getting Started With OCaml: An Introduction</a></h3>
<p>Are you using OCaml for the first time or onboarding new team members? This course is a perfect fit. It covers the fundamental language concepts, tools, and techniques and culminates with a practical exercise in which participants build their own application. The course includes modules on the Dune build system, the OCaml Platform, imperative and modular programming, debugging, and more!</p>
<p>OCaml stands out among its peers with its expressive syntax, robust type system, and exceptional performance. After this course, your team will walk away with an understanding of OCaml's main features and how to start using them to their advantage.</p>
<h3><a href="https://tarides.com/services/training/">Mastering OCaml: Advanced Techniques</a></h3>
<p>This is the best choice for teams already familiar with OCaml and who are using it in their projects. It enables your teams to adopt advanced techniques, such as Web application development with <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml">JSOO</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">WSOO</a>, multicore programming with <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio">Eio</a>, <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>, testing, and GADTs, making expert-level techniques accessible to our clients.</p>
<p>This course allows you to customise modules to cover the exact tools and techniques your teams need the most. This allows them to improve the quality of the code they produce precisely and effectively, boosting OCaml developersâ€™ confidence and skills.</p>
<h3><a href="https://tarides.com/services/training/">Scalable, Flexible, and Powerful: Language-neutral Functional Programming</a></h3>
<p>Help your teams understand the core functional programming principles that help developers produce safer, less buggy, and more readable code - regardless of their programming language. This three day course is a rich introduction to functional programming. The first day focusses on the foundations, including recursive and higher-order functions, type annotations and type inference, and function composition and pipes. The second day delves deeper into types covering topics like immutability, monads, and currying. The final day pushes further into I/O monads, continuations, type algebra, and more.</p>
<p>This course is the perfect choice for teams responding to the <a href="https://www.tarides.com/blog/2024-03-07-a-time-for-change-our-response-to-the-white-house-cybersecurity-press-release/">growing push for safer code</a>, wanting to adopt functional programming in their workflows. It is also an excellent choice for onboarding new teams, helping them gain confidence and competence with a new way of programming.</p>
