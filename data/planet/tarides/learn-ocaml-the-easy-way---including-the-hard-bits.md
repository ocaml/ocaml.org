<p>OCaml is a valuable and powerful tool, combining performance, security, and reliability. Joining the ecosystem, community, and learning the language can help you make the most of its capabilities if you're not already familiar with it. But how can we make learning OCaml easier? As with other functional programming languages, its visibility can be limited by factors such as your educational and professional environment, or the programmers you follow. Nevertheless, the world of software development is <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-03-07-a-time-for-change-our-response-to-the-white-house-cybersecurity-press-release/">increasingly recognising the strengths of functional programming</a> in general and <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2023-12-14-ocaml-memory-safety-and-beyond/">OCaml in particular</a>.</p>
<p>To meet the growing interest in OCaml, we aim to make learning the language as straightforward as possible. For individuals,  we’re prioritising tutorials, books, and events centred around OCaml. For teams and organisations, we offer <a href="https://tarides.com/services/training/">OCaml courses</a> for both basic and advanced training.</p>
<h2>The Best Ways to Learn OCaml: For the Independent Learner</h2>
<h3>OCaml.org</h3>
<p>Whether you’re looking to write a ‘hello world’ or delve into the details of the OCaml compiler, the central resource is OCaml.org. The <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs">Learn</a> area provides a range of resources, including tutorials, exercises, and a directory of books and academic papers, catering to different skill levels. The page also offers ways to install the <a href="https://ocaml.org/install#linux_mac_bsd">latest version of OCaml</a>, access the <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/index.html">manual</a>, and explore  OCaml’s documentation. The team has taken inspiration from other languages like Python, Rust, and the functional language Haskell to improve the resources available to learn OCaml.</p>
<p>These resources are tailored to the independent learner, using their free time to pursue knowledge, or the <a href="https://ocaml.org/academic-users">teacher needing materials</a> for their students. We support the continuous improvement of tutorials and documentation on OCaml.org, and the accessibility of books, papers, and other learning materials.

<h2>The Best Ways to Learn OCaml: Tailored Training in OCaml</h2>
<p>In large organisational teams, relying on individual learning or the dissemination of knowledge from a few experts can be time-consuming and inconsistent. Tailored courses enable simultaneous training for the entire group, fostering collaboration in tackling new challenges. To make learning OCaml easier for groups, we’ve created courses to enhance team competence in the language. Here’s what our OCaml courses offer.</p>
<h3>Our Foundational Course <a href="https://tarides.com/services/training/"><em>Starting with OCaml: An Introduction</em></a></h3>
<p>This course teaches core OCaml programming concepts through theory and practice, and has been designed to facilitate a smooth transition for engineers from other languages, including imperative programming. It covers OCaml’s history, design choices, and key functional programming concepts such as functions, recursion, and higher-order functions alongside critical concepts like tuples, the OCaml type system, type inference, pattern matching, and polymorphism.</p>
<p>The bulk of the course comprises several modules that introduce the practical building blocks of programming with OCaml. This includes methods: imperative and modular programming, data structures, error handling, interfacing with C, and command-line parsing. It also offers guidance on tooling: <code>opam</code>, Dune, VSCode, debugging and profiling, concurrent programming with <code>lwt</code>, and testing using expect tests and QuickCheck.</p>
<p>Finally, the course would not be complete without hands-on experience writing OCaml code. The modules on setting up the OCaml environment, building, documenting, and releasing an OCaml project culminate in an entire day spent on building an OCaml application from scratch. Participants will leave with a solid understanding of OCaml, the necessary tools for development, and practical application-building experience. Following this foundational course, your entire team will be familiar with the OCaml language and workflow.</p>
<h3>Our Higher-Level Course <a href="https://tarides.com/services/training/"><em>Mastering OCaml: Advanced Techniques</em></a></h3>
<p>The advanced course is designed for experienced users and teams looking to enhance their skills. It consists of three sections: advanced OCaml techniques, advanced methods for common OCaml tools, and advanced tooling.</p>
<p>Advanced OCaml techniques make up the bulk of the course, including generalised algebraic data types (<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/gadts-tutorial.html">GADTs</a>), multicore programming with OCaml 5, and transitioning from OCaml 4 to OCaml 5. Advanced methods for common OCaml tools cover using the  <a href="https://dune.build">Dune</a> build system, and <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/metaprogramming">PPX preprocessors</a>.</p>
<p>Topics in advanced tooling include: the <a href="https://mirage.io">MirageOS</a> library operating system for secure, high-performance, network applications; web development with  <a href="https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview">JS_of_ocaml</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">Wasm_of_ocaml</a>, and <a href="https://aantron.github.io/dream/">Dream</a>; concurrent programming with [Eio], and using <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-04-24-under-the-hood-developing-multicore-property-based-tests-for-ocaml-5/">property-based testing</a> to evaluate programs. This course aims to equip teams already using OCaml with new skills and tools. An advanced course with deep topics, the course is tailored to focus on relevant areas for your team, taking them to the next level.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the biggest benefits we offer with our courses is <strong>customisation</strong>. We understand that teams have unique challenges and goals, and offer you the option to create a course that fits your needs. Not only can you pick a selection of topics from the <a href="https://tarides.com/services/training/">advanced OCaml</a> modules, but you can completely tailor the training with a customised itinerary. This is negotiated on a per-instance basis, and you can schedule a <a href="https://tarides.com/contact/">free consultation</a> to discuss what that could look like for your teams.</p>
