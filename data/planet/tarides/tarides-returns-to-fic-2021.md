<p>Last year, Tarides had the honour of winning the &ldquo;Coup de Coeur&rdquo; Startup Award
at the International Cybersecurity Forum (FIC). It&rsquo;s the leading cybersecurity
event in the EU. It&rsquo;s both a forum, to present and discuss innovations and
reflect on the state of the European cybersecurity ecosystem, and a trade fair,
where cybersecurity and other tech professionals can meet and network.</p>
<p>This year, Tarides returns to FIC with their own booth! Our representatives,
including founder and CEO of Tarides, Thomas Gazagnaire, look forward to making
new connections, looking for collaborators, and catching up with colleagues.</p>
<p>The FIC theme for 2021 centres on encouraging &ldquo;a collective and collaborative
cybersecurity.&rdquo; From the <a href="https://www.forum-fic.com/en/home/discover/what-is-the-fic.htm">FIC
Website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&rdquo;Collective, because each stakeholder is responsible not only for its own
security but also for the security of every other stakeholder, and therefore of
the whole. Collaborative, because cooperation and information sharing are
essential to compensate the asymmetry between the &laquo;attacker&raquo; and the
&laquo;defender&raquo;&hellip;FIC 2021 will focus on the major operational, industrial,
technological, and strategic challenges of cooperation&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solutions for most cybersecurity issues already exist, and we at Tarides are
happy to consult on our many solutions that can make your systems more secure.
From secure emails to runtime protection to secure IoT protocols, our
representatives can help!</p>
<p>So stop by the Tarides booth at FIC to chat about your options. We&rsquo;ll have
snacks and other goodies, too!</p>
