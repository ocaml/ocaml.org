<p>We are thrilled to have been selected by the <a href="https://www.opensourcesummit.paris">Paris Open Source Summit</a>
committee to talk about &ldquo;Secure-by-design IoT applications using MirageOS&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Paris Open Source Summit is an annual event where you can connect to
open-source communities and learn from tech leaders, project committers and
CTOs about the latest technical solutions, innovative uses and societal
challenges of open digital technology.</p>
<p>Thomas Gazagnaire, Tarides CEO/CTO, will explain what makes MirageOS a good
framework to build IoT applications and how we can use embedded devices running
on ARMv8, ESP32 or RISC-V to run secure and end-to-end open-source
infrastructure services such as VPN proxies and email servers. He will also
highlight how this infrastructure will be used to form the basis of OSMOSE: a
secure, distributed and privacy-preserving platform to write user-centric IoT
applications.</p>
<p>MirageOS is a library operating system (using the MIT license) which enables the
construction of unikernels: specialized services where the runtime binary
contains only the necessary code for execution and no more. Unikernels have a
drastically smaller attack surface than service deployments in traditional
operating systems and could lead to 1000x less code for the full application
stack. Moreover, as MirageOS is written in a memory safe language (OCaml), a
full class of bugs related to memory corruption &ndash; representing <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">70% of the
released CVEs</a> in classic operating systems written in C &ndash;
can no longer appear. These two properties combined (and more!) allow MirageOS
to build &ldquo;secure-by-design&rdquo; applications where everything &ndash; from the high-level
business logic to the low-level device drivers &ndash; has been designed to be as
secure as possible.</p>
<p>To learn more about the project, attend the Paris Open Source Summit! The talk
will take place during the '<a href="https://www.opensourcesummit.paris/EMBEDDED+&amp;+IOT_168_5745.html">Embedded &amp; IOT</a>' section
at 14:50 &ndash; 15:20 on December 10th, 2019.</p>
