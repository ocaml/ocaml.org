<p>CUFP will again be having Bird-of-a-Feather sessions to discuss a variety of FP topics.  Last year's BOFs were a lot of fun, with topics ranging from meta-programming to packaging systems.</p>
<p>But we need you to help!  The BOFs only happen if people propose them.  Click <a href="http://cufp.org/2011/bofs.html">here</a> to learn more about the BOFs and to find out how to propose a topic.</p>
