<p>CUFP 2012 was a very successful and fun gathering in Copenhagen this year, with impeccable local arrangements (and the best conference lunches ever, by wide acclaim!).</p>
<p>All of the talk videos are now <a href="http://cufp.org/2012/">available online for
free</a> in our video section, including the
<a href="http://cufp.org/2012/keynote-kresten-krab-thorup-cto-trifork-adopting-f.html">keynote</a>
by Kresten Thorup from Trifork. This year had an interesting emphasis
on <a href="http://cufp.org/videos/keyword/2270.html">biological computing</a>
and <a href="http://cufp.org/videos/keyword/2273.html">critical
infrastructure</a> from a
variety of companies and universities, showing off the impact of
functional programming on very important areas of
society. Additionally, we welcomed back some old faces from the early
days of CUFP to give us updates on the progress of functional
programming in established organisations such as <a href="http://cufp.org/2012/yaron-minsky-jane-street-jane-street-status-report.html">Jane Street
Capital</a>
and
<a href="http://cufp.org/2012/matthias-gorgens-citrix-haskell-xenclient.html">Citrix</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the speakers and attendees for making this year such a success, and see you in Boston in 2013!</p>
<p>Michael Sperber and Anil Madhavapeddy</p>
