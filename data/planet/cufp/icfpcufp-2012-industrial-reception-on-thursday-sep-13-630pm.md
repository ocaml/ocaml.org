<p>ICFP/CUFP will host an industrial reception on Thursday, September 13
at 6:30PM that will be open to all registrants of an ICFP-affiliated
event on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.  (I.e. if you're registered
for any CUFP event, you're good to go.)  It will happen at <a href="http://www.bojesen.dk/BOJESEN-AT-AXELBORG.95.aspx">Bojesen,
Axelborg</a>, Vesterbrogade 4A, DK-1620 K&oslash;benhavn V.</p>
<p>Thanks to our generous sponsors, there'll be snacks and drinks on the
premises!</p>
<p>This reception will have two purposes:</p>
<ul><li><p>Companies that are hiring can connect with ICFP/CUFP attendees looking
 for a job.</p>
</li><li><p>Companies offering FP services (such as training or development) can
 advertise them.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If you represent a company that wants to do one of those two things,
please send Mike Sperber (sperber(at)deinprogramm(dot)de) and Anil Madhavapeddy
(avsm2(at)cl(dot)cam(dot)ac(dot)uk) a short e-mail saying so.  If you're a sponsor of
ICFP, we'd appreciate if you could remind us in that e-mail, too.</p>
<p>There will be up to 20 posterboards (approx. 900 mm wide and 1800
mm high, dark blue cloth, usable on both sides) available for
displaying posters of size up to A1 (any orientation) or A0 (only
portrait orientation).  If you're a sponsor, you'll be able to reserve
one of those.  Also, if you're not a sponsor but would like to put up
a poster, please let me know ASAP, as we'll hand out the slots on a
first-come first-serve basis.</p>
<p>We'll also do a short round of introductions with 1-3 sentences each.
If you represent a gold or platinum sponsor, you'll get the
opportunity to say more.  Again, we'd appreciate if you remind us of
that fact so we can do a reasonable job of MCing the event.</p>
<p>See you in Copenhagen!</p>
