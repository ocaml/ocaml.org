<p>After a very successful CUFP 2011 in Tokyo, the videos are now available <a href="http://cufp.org/2011/">online</a>. Thanks to Marius Eriksen's excellent scribe notes, we have also published a <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A85vaWut">formal report</a> summarising the event in the Journal of Functional Programming.</p>
<p>CUFP 2012 will be held in <a href="http://cufp.org/2012/">Denmark</a>, and the <a href="http://cufp.org/2012/call-presentations.html">Call for Presentations</a> is still open until the 29th June!</p>
