users to safely express patterns that are awkward in OCaml, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

open-source ecosystem, especially when it comes to machine learning. But
the heavy use of notebooks can make it difficult to support. Notebooks
have a very different lifecycle than regular code, and aren&amp;rsquo;t always
rigorously version controlled. And while most of our code (much of it
written in OCaml) lives in a monorepo, putting all notebooks there is
difficult; many notebooks end up being stored all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

the art in &amp;ldquo;zero-knowledge&amp;rdquo; cryptography. We decided to have a go in
our free time at submitting solutions to both the Multi-Scalar

using the same open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://hardcaml.com/&quot;&gt;Hardcaml&lt;/a&gt; libraries
that Jane Street uses for our own FPGA development. We believe by
using Hardcaml we were able to more efficiently and robustly come up
with designs in the short competition period. These designs also
interact with the standard vendor RTL flow and so we hope they will be
useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;

be the world&amp;rsquo;s first organized futures exchange. Instead of directly
exchanging money for rice on the spot, merchants would agree on a price
and future date at which rice and money would be exchanged. This allowed
farmers and consumers to hedge their risk. As a result, information
about the abundance or lack of rice would travel across the country as
fast as rice merchants carried it.&lt;/p&gt;

estimate these costs and propose ways to reduce them. Essentially,
this is a numerical optimization problem.&lt;/p&gt;

May 17th, from our very own Dominick LoBraico. This one is about how to
represent configurations with programs. In some sense, this is an obvious idea.
Lots of programmers have experienced the dysphoria that comes from watching your
elegant little configuration format metamorphize into a badly constructed
programming language with miserable tools. This happens because, as you try to
make your configs clearer and more concise, you often end up walking down the
primrose path of making your config format ever more language-like. But you
never really have the time to make it into a proper language.&lt;/p&gt;

can be erased by a few bad decisions in scheduler policy, affinity, or
background workload on a server.&lt;/p&gt;

code. The usual solution for this is to write a code generator; for instance in
the form of a ppx rewriter in the case of OCaml code. This however comes with a
cost: code generators are harder to review than plain code and it is a new
syntax to learn for other developers. So when the repetitive pattern is local to
a specific library or not widely used, it is often not worth the effort.
Especially if the code in question is meant to be reviewed and maintained by
several people.&lt;/p&gt;

migrating from camlp4 to ppx. After having developed equivalent ppx rewriters
for our camlp4 syntax extensions, the last step is to actually translate the
code source of all our libraries and applications from the camlp4 syntax to the
standard OCaml syntax with extension points and attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

them can help write faster code. Simply put, a CPU register is a storage for a
single variable. CPU can keep data in memory or cache or in registers and
registers are often much faster. Furthermore, some operations are possible only
when the data is in registers. Hence, the OCaml compiler tries to keep as many
variables as it can in the registers.&lt;/p&gt;

way. Essentially, we built a centralized repo and a continuous integration
system whose job was to merge in new changesets. The key responsibility of this
system was to make sure that a change was rejected unless it merged, compiled
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html&quot; title=&quot;The Not Rocket Science Rule&quot;&gt;tested
