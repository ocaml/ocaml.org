<p>In <a href="https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/goaljobs-part-3/">part 3</a> I described how to write targets which can access network resources, and how to use memoization to make them run fast.  In this (last) part of the series, I&rsquo;ll describe the final feature of goaljobs &mdash; periodic jobs.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use <code>make</code> to monitor a git repository and do a build when a new commit appears there would I guess be three choices: You could just run the <code>make</code> command manually over and over again.  You could have a git hook that runs <code>make</code>.  Or you have a cron job the periodically checks the git repository.</p>
<p>The git hook is the ideal solution for goaljobs too, but goaljobs also has cron-like <b>periodic jobs</b> built in, and they are very easy to use:</p>
<pre>
every 30 minutes (fun () -&gt;
  let commit =
    shout &quot;cd %s &amp;&amp; git rev-parse HEAD&quot; repo in
  require (git_commit_tested commit)
)
</pre>
<p><code>every 30 minutes</code> is self-explanatory (right?).  The function that runs every half-an-hour is two lines of code.  The first line uses <code>shout</code> to run a <b>sh</b>ell command and capture the <b>out</b>put.  In this case git prints the current commit.  The second command requires that the <code>git_commit_tested</code> goal is reached for this commit.</p>
<p>One way to implement this goal would be:</p>
<pre>
let goal git_commit_tested commit =
  let key = sprintf &quot;repo-tested-%s&quot; commit in
  target (memory_exists key);

  sh &quot;
      git clone %s test
      cd test
      ./configure
      make
      make check
  &quot; repo_url;

  memory_set key &quot;1&quot;
</pre>
<p>This code clones the repository and runs <code>make check</code> to test it.  It uses the Memory (ie. memoization) to ensure that the tests are run at most once per commit.</p>
<p>Actually this is not quite true: the tests run successfully once, but if the test fails, it will keep running every 30 minutes and nag you about it.  It&rsquo;s trivial to change the memoization to remember failures as well as successes, or you could consider the repeated nagging to be a feature not a bug &hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it!  The goaljobs website <i>will</i> be this (I&rsquo;ve not uploaded it yet, but will do in the next day or two):</p>
