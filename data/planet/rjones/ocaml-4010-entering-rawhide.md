<p>After using OCaml for around 10 years it is still my favourite language, and it&rsquo;s amazing how far ahead of other programming languages it remains to this day.</p>
<p><a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-09/msg00173.html">OCaml 4.01.0 was released on Thursday</a> and I&rsquo;m putting it into Fedora Rawhide over this weekend.</p>
<p>Debuginfo is now (partially) enabled.  <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2012/08/20/ocamlpro-and-4.00.0.html">The OCaml code generator has produced good quality DWARF information for a while</a>, and now you are able to debug OCaml programs in gdb under Fedora:</p>
<pre>
$ <b>sudo debuginfo-install ocaml ocaml-findlib</b>
$ <b>gdb /usr/bin/ocamlfind</b>
[...]

<p>GDB only understands location data at the moment, so you can&rsquo;t yet query variables (although I understand OCaml generates the correct DWARF info for this, GDB just doesn&rsquo;t know how to print OCaml expressions).</p>
<p>There will also be some limitations on the debuginfo built at first.  At the moment it doesn&rsquo;t include debuginfo for OCaml libraries called from an OCaml program, because of problems that need to be worked out with the toolchain.  Mixed OCaml binary / C library debuginfo does work.</p>
