<p>A reflection on the new year&hellip; Today, Tezos is a global network and an
open source project with developers spanning over five continents. In
the inception of this project, the French company OCamlPro which, to
this day, stills develops numerous projects around Tezos, played a
particularly important role. Indeed, they were the first home of the
research engineers who laid down the cornerstone of the code base, in
tight collaboration with Arthur Breitman and the architect of the
project, and DLS. We take some time today to remember those early days
and celebrate the flourishing of this once small project.</p>
