<p>When you are beginning in a new programming language, it is sometimes helpful to have an overview of the documentation, that you can pin on your wall and easily have a look at it while you are programming. Since we couldn&rsquo;t find such Cheat Sheets, we decided to start writting our own cheat sheets for OCaml.</p>
<p>Beware, these documents are drafts, that we plan to improve in the next months. In the meantime, feel free to tell us how we could improve them, what is missing, and where the focus should be !</p>
