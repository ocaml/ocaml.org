<p>We are happy to announce the final release of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.0">opam 2.0.0</a>.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, we released a <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-0-rc4">last release candidate</a> to be later promoted to 2.0.0, synchronised with the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">opam package repository</a> <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-0-repo-upgrade-roadmap/">upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to update as soon as you see fit, to continue to get package updates: opam 2.0.0 supports the older formats, and 1.2.2 will no longer get regular updates. See the <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/2.0-preview/doc/Upgrade_guide.html">Upgrade Guide</a> for details about the new features and changes.</p>
<p>The website opam.ocaml.org has been updated, with the full 2.0.0 documentation pages. You can still find the documentation for the previous versions in the corresponding menu.</p>
<p>Package maintainers should be aware of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the master branch of the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">opam package repository</a> is now in the 2.0.0 format
</li>
<li>package submissions must accordingly be made in the 2.0.0 format, or using the new version of <code>opam-publish</code> (2.0.0)
</li>
<li>anything that was merged into the repository in 1.2 format has been automatically updated to the 2.0.0 format
</li>
<li>the 1.2 format repository has been forked to its own branch, and will only be updated for critical fixes
</li>
</ul>
<p>For custom repositories, the <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-0-repo-upgrade-roadmap/#Advice-for-custom-repository-maintainers">advice</a> remains the same.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Installation instructions (unchanged):</p>
<ol>
<li>From binaries: run
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">sh &lt;(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
</code></pre>
<p>or download manually from <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.0">the Github &quot;Releases&quot; page</a> to your PATH. In this case, don't forget to run <code>opam init --reinit -ni</code> to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>From source, using opam:
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">opam update; opam install opam-devel
</code></pre>
<p>(then copy the opam binary to your PATH as explained, and don't forget to run <code>opam init --reinit -ni</code> to enable sandboxing if you had version 2.0.0~rc manually installed)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>From source, manually: see the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/tree/2.0.0-rc4#compiling-this-repo">README</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope you enjoy this new major version, and remain open to <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues">bug reports</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues">suggestions</a>.</p>
