<p>For 12 years now, OCamlPro has been empowering a large range of customers,
allowing them to harness state-of-the-art technologies and languages like OCaml
and Rust. Our not-so-small-anymore company steadily grew into a team of
highly-skilled and passionate engineers, experts in Computer Science, from
Compilation and Software Analysis to Domain Specific Languages design and
Formal Methods.</p>
<p>In this article, as every year (see <a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2022_01_31_2021_at_ocamlpro/">last
year's post</a>) - albeit
later than we do usually, we review some of the work we did during 2022, in
many different worlds as shows the wide range of the missions we achieved.</p>

          </h2>
<p>OCamlPro is not just a R&amp;D software company, we like to think about it
more as a team of people who like to work together. So, we are proud
to introduce you the incredible human beings that joined us in 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pierre Villemot</em> joined us in June. After three years of research at the
Weizmann Institute on transcendental measures in Arithmetical Geometry, he was
recruited and became the main maintainer of the Alt-Ergo Theorem Prover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mil&agrave;n Martos</em> joined us in July. He studied Chemistry and Computer Science at
ENS, and he holds an MBA. He joined the Team as a Presales Engineer and as a
Junior OCaml Web Developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nathana&euml;lle Courant</em> joined us in September. She holds a Master's degree
from &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure in Paris, and is finishing her Ph.D. on
efficient and verified reduction and convertibility tests for theorem
provers. She joined OCamlPro in 2022 and works on the OCaml optimizer, in the
Flambda team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Arthur Carcano</em> also joined us in September. Arthur is a Rust developer
interested in performance optimization, software design, and crafting
powerful and user-friendly tools. After completing his M.Sc. in Computer
Science at ENS Ulm, he obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science
from Universit&eacute; de Paris.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Emilien Lemaire</em> joined us in December 2022. After an internship on
typechecking COBOL statements, he will be working with our COBOL
team on creating a studio of modern tools for COBOL.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor"></a>Modernizing Core Parts of Real Life Applications<a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/feed#apps">&#9875;</a>
          </h2>
<p>We love to harness our IT expertise to give a competitive advantage to
our clients by modernizing core chunks of key infrastructures. For
example, we are working with the French Public Finances General
Directorate on two of their modernization projects, to reimplement the
language used for the computation of the Income Tax (<a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/feed#mlang">MLang</a>)
and to provide support on the GnuCOBOL compiler used by the MedocDB
application (<a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/feed#cobol">COBOL</a>).</p>

<p>In 2022, our work on MLANG has passed a significant milestone: our work may no
longer be considered a prototype! Code generation is now behaviourly compliant
with the upstream compiler. David focused on rewriting the C architecture,
which has been of great aid in iterating through each version of this new
implementation of MLANG.</p>
<p>As far as testing goes, we were allowed to compare the results of our
implementation against the ones of the upstream calculator, on real-life inputs
too. We are talking about calculations of immense scale, which entails a highly
performance-dependent project. Naturally, we managed to produce something of
equivalent performance which was a very important matter for our contractors
which have, since then, voiced their satisfaction. It is always great for us to
feel appreciated for our work.</p>
<p>The next step is to make a production-level language by the end of 2023, so
stay tuned if you are interested in this great project.</p>

<p>In 2022, we started contributing to <a href="https://github.com/ocamlpro/gnucobol">the GnuCOBOL
project</a>: the GnuCOBOL compiler
is, today, the only free, open-source, industrial-grade alternative to
proprietary compilers by IBM and Micro-Focus. A cornerstone feature of
GnuCOBOL is its ability to understand proprietary extensions to COBOL
(dialects), to decrease the migration work of developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2022_01_31_2021_at_ocamlpro/#cobol">Last year's <code>at OCamlPro</code></a>
presented our gradual introduction to the
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> Universe as one of our
latest technical endeavours. In the beginning, our main objective was
to wrap our heads around the state of the environment for COBOL
developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our main contribution for now is to add support for the GCOS7 dialect,
to ease migration from obsolete GCOS Bull mainframes to a cluster of
PCs running GnuCOBOL for our first COBOL customer, the French
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_des_Finances_publiques">DGFIP</a>
(<em>Public Finances General Directorate</em>). We also contributed a few fixes and
small useful general features. Our contributions are gradually upstreamed in
the official version of GnuCOBOL.</p>
<p>The other part of our COBOL strategy is to progressively develop our
<a href="https://get-superbol.com/">SuperBOL Studio</a>, a set of modern tools
for COBOL, and especially GnuCOBOL, based on an OCaml parser for COBOL
that we have been improving during the year to support the full COBOL
standard. More on this next year, hopefully !</p>

<p>OCamlPro's culture is one of human values and appeal for everything scientific.</p>
<p>Programming languages of all nature have caught our attention at some point in
time. As a consequence of years of expertise in all kinds of languages, we have
grown fond of strongly-typed, memory-safe ones. Eventually gravitating towards
Rust, we have since then invested significantly in adding this state-of-the-art
language to our toolsets, one of which being the <a href="https://training.ocamlpro.com/">trainings we deliver to
industrial actors</a> of various backgrounds to
help them grasp at such technological marvels.</p>
<p>Our trainers are qualified engineers, some of which have more than ten years of
experience in the industry in R&amp;D, Formal Methods and embedded systems alike,
seven of which being solely in Rust.</p>
<p>Strong of our collective experiences, 2022 was indeed the stage for many
contributions and missions, some of which we will share with you right now.</p>

<p>In 2022, we have seized the opportunity to work at the threshold between Java
and Rust for our clients and academic partners of the CEA (Commissariat aux
&Eacute;nergies Atomiques et aux &Eacute;nergies Alternatives). The product was a
Rust-written and Rust-encoded Java class hierarchy code generator.</p>
<p>Ecore is the core metamodel at the heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Modeling_Framework">Eclipse Modeling Framework
(EMF)</a>, which is used
internally at the CEA. Ecore is a superset of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a> and allows for
the engineers of the CEA to express a Java class hierarchy through a graphical
interface. In practice, this allows for the generation of basic Java models for
the engineers to then build upon.</p>
<p>Our mission consisted in writing, in Rust, a new model generator for them to
use in their workflows and to make it capable of generating Rust code instead
of Java.</p>
<p>The cost for harnessing the objective qualities of a new implementation
in Rust was to have us tackle the scientific challenges pertaining to the
inherent structural differences between both languages. Our goal was to find a
way to encode, in Rust, a way to express the semantics of the hierarchy of
classes of Java, hence merging the worlds of Rust and Java on the way there.</p>
<p>Eventually, our partners were convinced the challenges were worth
the improved speed at which models were generated. Furthermore, the now
embedded-programming compliant platform, the runtime safety and even Rust's
broader WebAssembly-ready toolchain have cleared a new path for the
future iterations of their internal projects.</p>

<p>Here's a project suited for all who, like us, are Formal Methods, functional
programming and formal methods enthousiasts:
<a href="https://leanprover.github.io/about/">Lean</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lean is a functional programming language that makes it easy to write correct

Lean programming primarily involves defining types and functions. This allows
your focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its data, rather
than the details of programming.</p>

<p>Late 2022 was finally time for us to put into practice the knowledge we have
acquired about <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> over the years by
writing and presenting the first compiler of a real-world functional language
targeting the WasmGC proposal.</p>
<p>Although a <em>relatively</em> new technology, its great design, huge potential, and
already very tangible and interesting use-cases have not escaped our watch and
we are very happy to have kept a sharp eye on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a
stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a <strong>portable compilation
target</strong> for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client
and server applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc">WasmGC</a> is the name of the on-going working
group and proposal towards eventually adding support for garbage collection to
Wasm. December 2022 saw a significant amount of work accomplished by both L&eacute;o
Andr&egrave;s (whose thesis work is directed by Pierre and Jean-Christophe Filli&acirc;tre)
and Pierre Chambart towards finding viable compilation strategies from OCaml to
WasmGC. The goal was three-fold: make a prototype compiler to demonstrate the
soundness of the proposal, show that our compilation strategies were viable
and, finally, convince the commitee of the significance of the Wasm <code>i31ref</code>
for OCaml.</p>
<p>Our success in these three distinct points was paramount for OCaml, and other
languages that depend on the presence of <code>i31ref</code>, in order to one day benefit
from having WebAssembly as a natively supported compilation target for
Web-bound applications.</p>
<p>Here's a short listing of the work they have accomplished for that matter.
Please rest assured, <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/announcing-the-ocaml-wasm-organisation/12676/3">more detailed
explanations</a>
are to be expected on this very blog in the future so stay tuned!</p>

<p>OCamlPro develops and maintains <a href="https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/">Alt-Ergo</a>, an
automatic solver of mathematical formulas designed for program verification and
based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) technology. Alt-Ergo was

<p>The Alt-Ergo Users' Club was launched in 2019. Its 4th annual meeting was held
in late March 2022.</p>
<p>These meetings allow us to keep track of our members' needs and demands as well
as keep them informed with the latest changes to the SMT Solver; they are the
lifeline of our Club and help us guarantee that the project lives on, despite
the enormous task it represents.</p>
<p>This is a good time to appreciate the scope of the project: Alt-Ergo is the
fruit of more than 10 years' worth of Research &amp; Development. Currently
maintained by Pierre Villemot, whom we will introduce in the next section, as
full-time R&amp;D engineer.</p>

          </h4>
<p>In 2022, the Alt-Ergo team welcomed Pierre Villemot as full-time maintainer of
the project! His recruitement shows our commitment to the project's long term
maintenance and evolution. We are looking forward to seeing him take it to new
heights in future releases! Speaking of releases, 2022 has also been the stage
for Alt-Ergo's v2.4.2 minor release which introduced an update of the <code>labgltk</code>
library to version 3 and a set of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Now onto the more substantial changes to Alt-Ergo, the integration into
<code>next</code> of all the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of the SMT-LIB2 format parser
<a href="https://github.com/Gbury/dolmen">Dolmen</a> to Alt-Ergo's frontend;
</li>
<li>Improvement and test of models generation;
</li>
<li>Addition of mutually recursive functions for the legacy frontend <strong>and</strong> Dolmen alike;
</li>
<li>Significant amounts of documentation and code-cleaning;
</li>
<li>Implementation of systematical benchmarks of the SMT-LIB for regression prevention;
</li>
<li>Prototypical Dockerisation;
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are significative improvements to the User Experience and overall ergonomy
of the tool. You can already benefit from these changes by using Alt-Ergo's
<code>dev</code> version.</p>
<p>Finally, let us inform you that our candidacy for the DECYSIF project was
approved. Indeed, we and our partners at Adacore, Trust-In-Soft and the
<em>Laboratoire M&eacute;thodes Formelles</em> have been selected to conduct this funded
research project as consultant in Formal Methods. Now, we hope to be part of
collaborative R&amp;D projects to further fund core Alt-Ergo developments. This
should allow us to deepen collaboration with old partners like the Why3 team at
the Formal Methods Lab (LMF) and the ProofinUse consortium members. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Gbury/dolmen">Dolmen</a> is an OCaml Library developed by
Guillaume Bury as part of our Research and Development processes around Formal
Methods and our development efforts for our automated SMT-Solver
<a href="https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/">Alt-Ergo</a>.</p>
<p>Dolmen is a testimony of our push towards standardised input languages for
SMT-Solvers. Indeed, it provides flexible Menhir parsers and typecheckers for
several languages used in automated deduction such as: smtlib, ae (Alt-Ergo),
dimacs, iCNF, tptp and zf (zipperposition). And so, Dolmen aims at encompassing
the largest amount of input languages for automated deduction as possible and
provides the OCaml community with a centralised solution for their input
parsing and typechecking, hence keeping them from having to reimplement them
each time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Dolmen binary is used by the maintainers of the SMTLIB in order
to assert that newly submitted benchmarks to the SMTLIB are compliant with the
specification which makes Dolmen its <em>de facto</em> reference implementation. In
time, Dolmen will become the default frontend for Alt-Ergo and, we hope, any
other OCaml written SMT-Solver from now on.</p>

<a class="anchor"></a>Contributions to OCaml<a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/feed#ocaml">&#9875;</a>
          </h2>
<p>Last but not least, OCamlPro&rsquo;s DNA built itself on one of the most powerful and
elegant programming languages ever, born from more than 30 years of French
public Research in Computer Science, and widely used in safety critical
industries. OCaml&rsquo;s traits pervasively inspired many new languages (like F#).
We are proud to be part of this great community of researchers and computer
scientists.</p>

<p>2022 has been the theatre of a sustained and continuous effort from the opam
team.</p>
<p>The fruits of their labor have been compiled into an <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-2-0-alpha/">alpha release of version
2.2.0</a> by June 28th
2023, so here is a taste of what should make the final <code>2.2.0</code> version of opam a
treat for its users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows support: opam 2.2 comes with native Windows compatibility. You can now
use opam from your preferred Windows terminal!
</li>
<li>Recursive pinning: allows to have opam lookup for opam files
into subdirectories.
</li>
<li>Software Heritage binding: opam now integrates a fallback to Software Heritage
archive retrieval, based on SWHID. If an SWHID url is present in an opam file,
the fallback can be activated.
</li>
<li>Enhanced features for developers: as the development tools variable to share
a development setup, the <code>opam tree</code> command to have better an overview of
dependencies, new pinning subcommands, and so on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, 2022 was a very special year for opam. Indeed, 10 years prior,
on the 26th of June 2012, OCamlPro birthed version
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/0.1"><code>0.1</code></a> of what was to become
the official OCaml Package Manager, the cornerstone of the OCaml environment.</p>
<p>It was no small feat to make opam what it is today. It took approximately 5
years to bring <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-0-0-released/"><code>1.0.0</code></a> up
to <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-0/"><code>2.0.0</code></a> and another 3 to reach
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-1-0/"><code>2.1.0</code></a> all the while ensuring
changes were compliant with the current ecosystem (opam
repository, OCaml tooling) and the public's feedback and vision.</p>

<p>OCamlPro is proud to be working on Flambda2, an ambitious OCaml
optimizing compiler project, initiated with Mark Shinwell from Jane
Street, our long-term partner and client. Flambda2 builds upon its
predecessor: Flambda, which focused on reducing the runtime cost of
abstractions and removing as many short-lived allocations as
possible. Thus, Flambda2 not only shines with the maturity and
experience its architects acquired through years worth of R&amp;D and
dev-time for Flambda, but it improves upon them.</p>
<p>In 2022, Flambda2 was for the first time used for production workloads
and has been ever since! Indeed, we can officially say that Flambda2
left the realm of the prototype to enter one of real-life,
production-tested software for which we continue to provide
development and support as it has been for years now.</p>
<p>This achievement comes along having our engineers take more and more
action in maintaining the OCaml compiler. Being part of the OCaml
Core-Team is an honour.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2022, the Flambda Team welcomed a new member: Nathana&euml;lle
Courant will be joining forces with Pierre Chambart, Damien Doligez,
Vincent Laviron, Guillaume Bury to tackle the challenges inherent to
maintaining Flambda2 and that of the Core-Team.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more things Flambda2, stay tuned in with our blog,
there should be a series of very interesting articles coming up in the not-so
distant future!</p>
<p><em><strong>This work is allowed thanks to Jane Street's funding.</strong></em></p>
<p>In other OCaml compiler news, 2022 was also the year of the official release of
OCaml 5.0.0, also known as Multi-Core, on the 16th of December. This major
release introduced a new runtime system with support for shared memory
parallelism and effect handlers! This fabulous milestone is brought to us by the
joined work of the amazing people of the OCaml Core-Team; among them some of our
own.</p>
<p>Many thanks to all who take part in uncovering the yet untrodden paths of the
OCaml distribution!</p>
<p>What a time to be an OCaml enthousiast!</p>

<p>Just under 10 years ago, Fabrice Le Fessant initiated the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/ocaml-paris/events/99222322/">very first OCaml
Users in Paris</a>.</p>
<p>This event allowed OCaml users in Paris, professionals and amateurs alike, to
meet and exchange on OCaml novelties. This is still the case and the organising
crew now includes several people of diverse affiliations, maintaining the
purpose of this friendly event.</p>
<p>Every two months or so, the organisers reach out to the community, hail
volunteers and select presentations of on-going works. When the time and place
is settled, the <code>ocaml-paris</code> Meetup members are informed by various means.
The OCaml Users in PariS meetup is the place to enthusiastically share
knowledge and a few pizzas. It is supported by the <a href="https://ocaml-sf.org/">OCaml Software
Foundation</a> who graciously pays for the pizzas.</p>

<p>The OCaml Workshop is an international conference that focuses on everything
OCaml and is part of the ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming).</p>
<p>We attended many of these and have presented numerous papers throughout the
years.</p>
<p>In 2022, a paper co-authored by the maintainers of opam, the OCaml Package
Manager, was submitted and approved for presentation: &quot;Supporting a decade of
opam&quot;.</p>
<p>You can find the textual references of the talk
