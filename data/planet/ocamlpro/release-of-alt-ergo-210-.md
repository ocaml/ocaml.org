<p>A new release of Alt-Ergo (version 2.1.0) is available on Alt-Ergo's website: <a href="https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/#releases">https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/#releases</a>. An OPAM package for it will be published soon.</p>
<p>In this release, we mainly improved the CDCL-based SAT solver to get performances similar to/better than the old Tableaux-like SAT. The CDCL solver is now the default Boolean reasoner. The full list of CHANGES is available <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/alt-ergo/blob/2.1.0/sources/CHANGES">here</a>.</p>
<p>Despite our various tests, you may still encounter some issues with this new solver.  Please, don't hesitate to report bugs, ask questions, and give your feedback!</p>
