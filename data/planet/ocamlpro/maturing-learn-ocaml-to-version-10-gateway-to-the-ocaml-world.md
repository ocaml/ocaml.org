<p>From the very start OCamlPro has been trying to help ease the learning of the
OCaml language. OCaml has been used around the world to teach about a variety
of Computer Science domains, from algorithmic to calculus, or functional
programming and compilation.</p>
<p>The language had been long taught in Academia when arose initiatives to offer
simple web tools to write and compile OCaml code in a simple web browser. We
launched the <a href="https://try.ocaml.pro/">TryOCaml</a> web editor for OCaml all the
way back in 2012. We were then appointed in 2015 by Roberto Di Cosmo from the
French University Paris-Diderot, to create the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/introduction-to-functional-programming-in-ocaml/">OCaml FUN
MOOC</a>
platform - and helped write the exercises used as pedagogical resources for the
<code>Introduction to Functional Programming</code>.</p>
<p>That is how the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml">Learn-OCaml open source learning platform</a> was born, created
then maintained at OCamlPro until 2018. Its steering was then transferred to
the <a href="http://ocaml-sf.org/actions/">OCaml Software Foundation</a> in 2019 and the
project steadily grew into a fully fledged tool used by teachers and students
around the world to this day.</p>
<p><em>Kudos to all OCaml teachers around the world, and to the LearnOCaml team, shepherded by Louis Gesbert</em></p>

<a class="anchor"></a>Learn-OCaml v1.0<a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/feed#loc">&#9875;</a>
          </h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is Learn-OCaml today?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml">Learn-OCaml</a> is a web platform for
orchestrating exercises for OCaml programming, with automated grading. The
interface features a code editor and client-side evaluation and grading; it
can be served statically, but if running the bundled server there are also
server-side saves, facilities for teachers to follow the progress of
students,
give assignments, get grades, etc.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that the steady work that has been accomplished
over the years on <code>Learn-OCaml</code> is finally bearing its fruits in the form of a
long-awaited soon-to-be-released <code>v1.0</code>!</p>

<p>For all historical intents and purposes, do refer to the <a href="https://files.ocamlpro.com/uploads/ocaml-2016-learn-ocaml.pdf">original 2016 OCaml
Workshop paper</a> on Learn-OCaml which kickstarted a long stream of updates and
improvements to the platform and its <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml-corpus">public corpus exercices</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The maintenance and development work on the platform is now funded by the OCaml Software Foundation.</strong></p>
