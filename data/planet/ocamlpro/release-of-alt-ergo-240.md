<p>A new release of Alt-Ergo (version 2.4.0)  is available.</p>
<p>You can get it from <a href="https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/">Alt-Ergo's website</a>. The associated opam package will be published in the next few days.</p>
<p>This release contains some major novelties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alt-Ergo supports incremental commands (push/pop) from the <a href="https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/">smt-lib </a>standard.
</li>
<li>We switched command line parsing to use <a href="https://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner">cmdliner</a>. You will need to  use <code>--&lt;option name&gt;</code> instead of <code>-&lt;option name&gt;</code>. Some options have also been renamed, see the manpage or the documentation.
</li>
<li>We improved the online documentation of your solver, available <a href="https://ocamlpro.github.io/alt-ergo/">here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This release also contains  some minor novelties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.mlw</code> and <code>.why</code> extension are depreciated, the use of <code>.ae</code> extension is advised.
</li>
<li>Add <code>--input</code> (resp <code>--output</code>) option to manually set the input (resp output) file format
</li>
<li>Add <code>--pretty-output</code> option to add better debug formatting and to add colors
</li>
<li>Add exponentiation operation, <code>**</code> in native Alt-Ergo syntax. The operator is fully interpreted when applied to constants
</li>
<li>Fix <code>--steps-count</code> and improve the way steps are counted (AdaCore contribution)
</li>
<li>Add <code>--instantiation-heuristic</code> option that can enable lighter or heavier instantiation
</li>
<li>Reduce the instantiation context (considered foralls / exists) in CDCL-Tableaux to better mimic the Tableaux-like SAT solver
</li>
<li>Multiple bugfixes
</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of changes is available <a href="https://ocamlpro.github.io/alt-ergo/About/changes.html">here</a>. As usual, do not hesitate to report bugs, to ask questions, or to give your feedback!</p>
