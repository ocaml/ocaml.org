<p><a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2019_09_13_updated_cheat_sheets_language_stdlib_2">Earlier</a>, we dusted-off our Language and Stdlib cheatsheets, for teachers and students. With more time, we managed to design an Opam 2.0 cheat-sheet we are proud of. It is organized into two pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The everyday average Opam use:
<ul>
<li>Installation, Configuration, Switches, Allowed URL formats, Packages, Exploring, Package pinning, Working with local pins, Sharing a dev setup, Configuring remotes.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peculiar advanced use cases (opam-managed project, publishing, repository maintenance, etc.):
<ul>
<li>Package definition files, Some optional fields, Expressions, External dependencies, Publishing, Repository administration.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, with the help of listings, we tried the use of colors for better readability. And we left some blank space for your own peculiar commands. Two versions are available (PDF):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Opam cheatsheet in <a href="https://ocamlpro.github.io/ocaml-cheat-sheets/ocaml-opam-bw.pdf">black &amp; white</a>
</li>
<li>The Opam cheatsheet in <a href="https://ocamlpro.github.io/ocaml-cheat-sheets/ocaml-opam.pdf">colour</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case do not hesitate to send us your suggestions on <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocaml-cheat-sheets">github</a>:</p>

<li>Louis and Raja, the lead Opam developers, designed this cheatsheet so as to shed light on some important features (some I even discovered even though I speak daily with them!). If a command <em>you</em> find useful is not mentioned, let us know and we&rsquo;ll add it. Feel free to ask for clarification and/or expansion of the manual!
</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
