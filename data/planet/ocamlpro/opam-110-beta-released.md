<p>We are very happy to announce the <strong>beta release</strong> of OPAM version 1.1.0!</p>
<p>OPAM is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple
simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and
a Git-friendly development workflow which. OPAM is edited and
maintained by OCamlPro, with continuous support from OCamlLabs and the
community at large (including its main industrial users such as
Jane-Street and Citrix).</p>
<p>Since its first official release <a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2013_03_15_opam_1.0.0_released">last March</a>, we have fixed many
bugs and added lots of <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/issues?milestone=17&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">new features and stability improvements</a>. New
features go from more metadata to the package and compiler
descriptions, to improved package pin workflow, through a much faster
update algorithm. The full changeset is included below.</p>
<p>We are also delighted to see the growing number of contributions from
the community to both OPAM itself (35 contributors) and to its
metadata repository (100+ contributors, 500+ unique packages, 1500+
packages). It is really great to also see alternative metadata
repositories appearing in the wild (see for instance the repositories
for <a href="https://github.com/vouillon/opam-android-repository">Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vouillon/opam-windows-repository">Windows</a> and <a href="https://github.com/search?q=opam-repo&amp;type=Repositories&amp;ref=searchresults">so on</a>). To be sure that the
community efforts will continue to benefit to everyone and to
underline our committment to OPAM, we are rehousing it at
<code>http://opam.ocaml.org</code> and switching the license to CC0 (see <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues/955">issue #955</a>,
where 85 people are commenting on the thread).</p>
<p>The binary installer has been updated for OSX and x86_64:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://github.com/ocaml/opam/blob/master/shell/opam_installer.sh</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also get the new version either from Anil's unstable PPA:
add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa-testing
apt-get update
sudo apt-get install opam</p>
<p>or build it from sources at :</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/releases/tag/1.1.0-beta</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: If you upgrade from OPAM 1.0, the first time you will run the
new <code>opam</code> binary it will upgrade its internal state in an incompatible
way: THIS PROCESS CANNOT BE REVERTED. We have tried hard to make this
process fault-resistant, but failures might happen. In case you have
precious data in your <code>~/.opam</code> folder, it is advised to <strong>backup that
folder before you upgrade to 1.1</strong>.</p>
