<p>In 2011, we shared several cheat sheets for OCaml. Cheat sheets are helpful to refer to, as an overview of the documentation when you are programming, especially when you&rsquo;re starting in a new language. They are meant to be printed and pinned on your wall, or to be kept in handy on a spare screen. We hope they will help you out when your rubber duck is rubbish at debugging your code!</p>
<p>Since we first shared them, OCaml and its related tools have evolved. We decided to refresh them and started with the two most-used cheat sheets&mdash;our own contribution to the start of the school year!</p>
<p>Download the revised version:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ocamlpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ocaml-lang.pdf">OCaml Language (lang)</a> (PDF)
</li>
<li><a href="http://ocamlpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ocaml-stdlib.pdf">OCaml Standard Library (stdlib)</a> (PDF)
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also find <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocaml-cheat-sheets">the sources on GitHub</a>. We welcome contributions, feel free to send patches if you see room for improvement! We&rsquo;re working on other cheat sheets: keep an eye on our blog to see updates and brand new cheat sheets.</p>
<p>While we were updating them, we realized how much OCaml had evolved in the last eight years. We&rsquo;ll tell you everything about our trip down memory lane very soon in another blogpost!</p>
