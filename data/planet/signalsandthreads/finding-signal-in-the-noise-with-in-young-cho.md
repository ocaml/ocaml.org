<p>In Young Cho thought she was going to be a doctor but fell into a trading internship at Jane Street. Now she helps lead the research groupâ€™s efforts in machine learning. In this episode, In Young and Ron touch on the porous boundaries between trading, research, and software engineering, which require different sensibilities but are often blended in a single person. They discuss the tension between flexible research tools and robust production systems; the challenges of ML in a low-data, high-noise environment subject to frequent regime changes; and the shift from simple linear models to deep neural networks.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com//finding-signal-in-the-noise/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
