<p>Doug Patti is a developer in Jane Street&rsquo;s Client-Facing Tech team, where he works on a system called Concord that undergirds Jane Street&rsquo;s client offerings. In this episode, Doug and Ron discuss how Concord, which has state-machine replication as its core abstraction, helps Jane Street achieve the reliability, scalability, and speed that the client business demands. They&rsquo;ll also discuss Doug&rsquo;s involvement in building a successor system called Aria, which is designed to deliver those same benefits to a much wider audience.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode &nbsp;on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/state-machine-replication-and-why-you-should-care" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>Some links to topics that came up in the discussion:</p><ul><li>Jane Street&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/institutional-services/electronic-trading-platforms/">client-facing trading platforms</a></li><li>A Signals and Threads episode on <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/multicast-and-the-markets/">market data and multicast</a> which discusses some of the history of state-machine replication in the markets.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-information-exchange.asp">FIX protocol</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast">UDP multicast</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_multicast#:~:text=A%20reliable%20multicast%20is%20any,as%20multi-receiver%20file%20transfer.">Reliable multicast</a></li><li><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/intro">Kafka</a></li></ul>
