<p>Richard Eisenberg is one of the core maintainers of Haskell. He recently joined Jane Street&rsquo;s Tools and Compilers team, where he hacks on the OCaml compiler. He and Ron discuss the powerful language feature that got him into PL design in the first place&mdash;dependent types&mdash;and its role in a world where AIs can (somewhat) competently write your code for you. They also discuss the differences between Haskell and OCaml; the perils of trying to make a language that works for everybody; and how best a company like Jane Street can collaborate with the open source community.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode &nbsp;on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/future-of-programming" target="_blank">website.</a></p><p>Some links to topics that came up in the discussion:</p><ul><li><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Dependent_type">Dependent types</a></li><li><a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a></li><li><a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/unboxed-types-for-ocaml/">Unboxed types in OCaml</a></li><li><a href="https://typeclasses.com/extensions-intro">Language extensions in Haskell</a></li></ul>
