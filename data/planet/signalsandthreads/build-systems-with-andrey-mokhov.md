<p>Most software engineers only think about their build system when it breaks; and yet, this often unloved piece of software forms the backbone of every serious project. This week, Ron has a conversation with Andrey Mokhov about build systems, from the venerable Make to Bazel and beyond. Andrey has a lot of experience in this field, including significant contributions to <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building/hadrian">the replacement</a> for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler&rsquo;s Make-based system and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/build-systems-a-la-carte-theory-and-practice/097CE52C750E69BD16B78C318754C7A4">Build Systems &agrave; la carte</a>, a paper that untangles the complex ecosystem of existing build systems. Ron and Andrey muse on questions like why every language community seems to have its own purpose-built system and, closer to home, where Andrey and the rest of the build systems team at Jane Street are focusing their efforts.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode along with links to related work on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/build-systems">website</a>.</p>
