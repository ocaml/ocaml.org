<p>Despite a steady trickle of newcomers, email still reigns supreme as the chief communication mechanism for the Information Age. At Jane Street, it&rsquo;s just as critical as anywhere, but there&rsquo;s one difference: the system at the heart of our email infrastructure is homegrown. This week, Ron talks to Dominick LoBraico, an engineer working on Jane Street&rsquo;s technology infrastructure, about how and why we built Mailcore, an email server written and configured in OCaml. They delve into questions around how best to represent the configuration of a complex system, when you should build your own and when you shouldn&rsquo;t, and the benefits of bringing a code-focused approach to solving systems problems.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode along with links to things we discussed on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/multicast-and-the-markets">website</a>.</p>
