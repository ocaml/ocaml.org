<p>Peter Bogart-Johnson was one of Jane Street&rsquo;s first program managers, and helped bring the art of PMing&mdash;where that &ldquo;P&rdquo; variously stands for &ldquo;project,&rdquo; &ldquo;product,&rdquo; or some blend of the two&mdash;to the company at large. He&rsquo;s also a poet and the editor of a literary magazine. In this episode, Peter and Ron discuss the challenge of gaining trust as an outsider: how do you teach teams a new way of doing things while preserving what&rsquo;s already working? The key, Peter says, is you listen; a good PM is an anthropologist. They also discuss how paying down technical debt isn&rsquo;t something you do instead of serving customers; what Jane Street looks for in PM candidates; and how to help teams coordinate in times of great change.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode &nbsp;on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/a-poets-guide-to-product-management" target="_blank">website.</a></p><p>Some links to topics that came up in the discussion:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lit-magazine.blogspot.com/">LIT Magazine</a> (more recently <a href="https://www.litmagazine.org/">here</a>)</li><li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/product/2023/03/12/pm-engineers-dont-hate.html">How to be a PM that engineers don&rsquo;t hate</a> and <a href="https://staysaasy.com/engineering/2023/06/18/how-to-be-an-engineer-pms-down-hate.html">How to be an engineer that PMs don&rsquo;t hate</a></li></ul>
