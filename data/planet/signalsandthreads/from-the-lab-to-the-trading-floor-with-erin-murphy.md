<p>Erin Murphy is Jane Street&rsquo;s first UX designer, and before that, she worked at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory building user interfaces for space missions. She&rsquo;s also an illustrator with her own quarterly journal. In this episode, Erin and Ron discuss the challenge of doing user-centered design in an organization where experts are used to building tools for themselves. How do you bring a command-line interface to the web without making it worse for power users? They also discuss how beauty in design is more about utility than aesthetics; what Jane Street looks for in UX candidates; and how to help engineers discover what their users really want.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode &nbsp;on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/from-the-lab-to-the-trading-floor" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>Some links to topics that came up in the discussion:</p><ul><li>Erin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.byerinmurphy.com/">website</a> that shows off her work.</li><li>Her <a href="https://www.farfromthis.com/">quarterly journal</a> of sketches and observations.</li><li>An <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/desalum/2017/05/10/erin-murphy/">article</a> about Erin&rsquo;s design work with NASA JPL.</li><li>A <a href="https://ai.jpl.nasa.gov/public/documents/papers/castano-etal-AERO2022.pdf">paper</a> that among other things talks about the user study work that Erin did at JPL.</li><li>Jane Street&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/6847048002/">current UX job opening</a>.</li></ul>
