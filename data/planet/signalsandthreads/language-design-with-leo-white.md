<p>Equal parts science and art, programming language design is very much an unsolved problem. This week, Ron speaks with Leo White, from Jane Street's Tools &amp; Compilers team, about cutting-edge language features, future work happening on OCaml, and Jane Street's relationship with the broader open-source community. The conversation covers everything from the paradox of language popularity, to advanced type system features like modular implicits and dependent types. Listen in, no programming languages PhD required!</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode along with links to things we discussed on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/multicast-and-the-markets">website</a>.</p>
