<p>It&rsquo;s a software engineer&rsquo;s dream: A compiler that can take idiomatic high-level code and output maximally efficient instructions. Ron&rsquo;s guest this week is Greta Yorsh, who has worked on just that problem in a career spanning both industry and academia. Ron and Greta talk about some&nbsp; of the tricks that compilers use to make our software faster, ranging from feedback-directed optimization and super-optimization to formal analysis.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode along with links to things we discussed on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/multicast-and-the-markets">website</a>.</p>
