<p>The ever-widening availability of FPGAs has opened the door to solving a broad set of performance-critical problems in hardware.&nbsp; In this episode, Ron speaks with Andy Ray, who leads Jane Street&rsquo;s hardware design team. Andy has a long career prior to Jane Street shipping hardware designs for things like modems and video codecs. That work led him to create <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml">Hardcaml</a>, a domain-specific language for expressing hardware designs. Ron and Andy talk about the current state-of-the-art in hardware tooling, the economics of FPGAs, and how the process of designing hardware can be improved by applying lessons from software engineering.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode along with links to related work on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/programmable-hardware/">website</a>.</p>
