title: Updating ARM64 Workers to Ubuntu Noble
description: "Early in the upgrade program for Ubuntu 24.04, there were permission
  issues when extracting tar files. The workaround was to update to the latest dev
  version of Docker. However, this didn\u2019t resolve all the issues on ARM64, so
  only one machine was updated and excluded from the base image builder work."
