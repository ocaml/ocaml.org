<p>We often say that ZFS is an excellent replicated file system, but not the best <em>local</em> filesystem. This led me to think that if we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zfs send</code> on one machine, we might want to write that out as a different filesystem. Is that even possible?</p>

<p>What is in a ZFS stream?</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fallocate <span class="nt">-l</span> 10G temp.zfs
zpool create tank <span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">pwd</span><span class="sb">`</span>/temp.zfs 
zfs create tank/home
<span class="nb">cp </span>README.md /tank/home
zfs snapshot tank/home@send
zfs send tank/home@send | hexdump
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I spent a little time writing an OCaml application to parse the record structure before realising that there already was a tool to do this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zstreamdump</code>. Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-d</code> flag shows the contents; you can see your file in the dumped output.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>zfs send tank/home@send | zstreamdump <span class="nt">-d</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this is <em>not</em> like a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tar</code> file. It is not a list of file names and their content. It is a list of block changes. ZFS is a tree structure with a snapshot and a volume being tree roots. The leaves of the tree may be unchanged between two snapshots. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zfs send</code> operates at the block level below the file system layer.</p>

<p>To emphasise this point, consider a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ZVOL</code> formatted as XFS. The structure of the send stream is the same: a record of block changes.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>zfs create <span class="nt">-V</span> 1G tank/vol
mkfs.xfs /dev/zvol/tank/vol
zfs snapshot tank/vol@send
zfs send tank/vol@send | zstreamdump <span class="nt">-d</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>ZVOLs are interesting as they give you a snapshot capability on a file system that doesnâ€™t have one. However, some performance metrics I saw posted online showed disappointing results compared with creating a file and using a loopback device. Furthermore, the snapshot would only be in a crash-consistent state as it would be unaware of the underlying snapshot. XFS does have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xfsdump</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xfsrestore</code>, but they are pretty basic tools.</p>
