title: Private repos in OCurrent
description: OCurrent has long wanted to access private repositories. You can achieve
  this by embedding a scoped PAT in the .git-credentials file, typically within the
  Docker container; however, this is untidy, to say the least! The approach presented
  works in cases where a GitHub app is used.
