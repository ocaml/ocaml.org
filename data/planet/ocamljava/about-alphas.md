<p>The project is finally <em>re</em>-open-sourced. Well, at least partially: the code for the compiler and associated tools, as well as libraries is available. The code for the runtime support library is not yet, but will follow once cleaned. Put otherwise, the part of the project written in OCaml is fully available, while the part written in Java remains <em>closed</em>. As it is nevertheless quite a big step forward, the version has changed from <em>early-access</em> to <em>alpha</em>.</p>
