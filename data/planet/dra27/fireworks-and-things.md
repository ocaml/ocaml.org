<p>Thanks to some targetted optimisations in the <a href="https://github.com/dra27/relocatable/commits/main/stack">script which manages Relocatable
OCaml’s various branches</a>,
I’d vastly improved the turn-around time when making changes to the patch-set
and propagating them through the various tests and backports. On Tuesday night,
the <em>entire</em> set of branches was green in CI (they’re sat <a href="https://github.com/dra27/ocaml/pulls?q=is:pr%20is:open%20label:relocatable%20combined">here</a>
with green check marks and everything). All that was to be needed on Wednesday
was to quickly update the opam packaging to take advantage of
Relocatable-awesomeness and plumb it all together. The 2022 version of the
packages for Ljubljana I knew contained a hack for searching a previous switch,
but I’d already investigated a more principled approach using opam’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build-id</code>
variable, so it would just be a matter of plumbing that in and using the cloning
mechanism already in that script.</p>

<p>And then I opened that scripts which I’d hacked together ready for the talk in
2022 in Ljubljana. I vaguely remember getting that all working at some ungodly
hour of the morning. The final clone is an unsightly:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="c"># Cloning</span>
    <span class="nv">SOURCE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">cat </span>clone-from<span class="si">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>
    <span class="nb">cp</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$SOURCE</span><span class="s2">/share/ocaml/config.cache"</span> <span class="nb">.</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>with no attempt to check the file lists 😭 Sorting out the installation targets
in OCaml’s build system is on my radar, but was not on my “Relocatable OCaml
blockers” TODO list.</p>

<p>Alas, the things which you can get away for a demo in a conference talk aren’t
quite the same as for actually maintained software. Ho hum - on the plus side,
Wednesday and Thursday’s hacking now yields a version of OCaml which can
generate opam install files properly, and which can therefore be co-opted to
produce the cloning script actually required. Onwards and upwards, apparently
now with memes…</p>
