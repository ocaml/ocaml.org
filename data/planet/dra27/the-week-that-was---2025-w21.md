<p>This week was a grant application, build systems, and code review - which it
turns out is <a href="https://what3words.com/grant.builds.review">somewhere in the Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>On holiday next week, so most of this week spent attempting to do 1.5-2x the
work in order to go on holiday (one dayâ€¦). Some minor diversions on the way.
The vagaries of opam-repository testing meant that an <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/27839#issuecomment-2851180027">unrelated PR</a>
highlighted that my solitary non-OCaml-compiler opam package <a href="https://ocaml.org/p/bitmasks/latest">bitmasks</a>
had become bitrots since for OCaml 5.1.0. One <a href="https://github.com/metastack/bitmasks/pull/7"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">to_list</code></a>
function later, and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/27899">1.5.0</a>
was born, for your representing-integer-masks-as-sets needs (I wrote the library
years ago for use in a never-released set of ODBC bindings, as I subsequently
got mildly distracted by opam and then the compiler).</p>

<p>More fun from the trenches doing some routine work on OCamlâ€™s GitHub Actions
workflows to prepare for some slightly less routine Relocatable OCaml stuff. We
still maintain OCaml 4.14 while the 5.x releases converge (weâ€™re very nearly
there: my hunch is that we may decide after OCaml 5.5 that weâ€™re in a position
to sunset 4.14, but weâ€™ll see). However, that means we have to sustain testing
infrastructure on a quite old branch and, well, continuous integration funnily
enough has to be continuously maintained. Previously, what would happen is that
weâ€™d be attempting to backport something to 4.14, would discover CI was broken
and then have to spend time fixing that before getting on with the work. I got
fed up with this after <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12520">ocaml/ocaml#12520</a>
and so did a bunch of work to synchronise all the branches (<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12846">ocaml/ocaml#12846</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12847">ocaml/ocaml#12847</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12848">ocaml/ocaml#12848</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12849">ocaml/ocaml#12849</a>). Not
particularly glamorous, but it means I can now periodically do:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>git log <span class="nt">--first-parent</span> <span class="nt">--oneline</span> upstream/trunk <span class="nt">--</span> .github tools/ci/actions
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and get a nice list of recent PRs to go through and simply cherry-pick the ones
which update the workflows - having got all the branches in sync, that tends to
be painless, and I got to a nice little sequence on <a href="https://github.com/dra27/ocaml/commits/4.14">dra27/ocaml#4.14</a>.
The ulterior motive is that I particularly wanted the updates in <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14013">ocaml/ocaml#14013</a>
to be able to get Relocatable OCaml back to 5.2 so that it can be rebased on to
OxCaml. Took the customary amount of to-and-fro between my ridiculous
<a href="https://github.com/dra27/relocatable/blob/main/stack">re-stacking-and-backport-script</a>
and CI, but I got <a href="https://github.com/dra27/ocaml/pull/169">the 5.2 version</a>
passing from the sunny hills of Wales only an hour or two into the holiday, and
while everyone was distracted playing <a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/games/fluxx">Fluxx</a>
(which lasted a surprisingly long time, for anyone whoâ€™s ever played itâ€¦).</p>

<p>Relocatable OCamlâ€™s test harness (<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14014">ocaml/ocaml#14014</a>)
had some very helpful reviews, and thatâ€™s now updated and ready to merge. So,
week off and then hopefully full steam ahead with getting the third PR branch
completed and, erm, some more reviewing ðŸ«£</p>
