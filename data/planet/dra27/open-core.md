description: "On 16 December 2000, a young @dra1 stepped out on to the stage of St
  Martin-in-the-Fields making what would be the first of many performances of Johann
  Sebastian Bach\u2019s great Mass in B minor. On 16 November last year, just under
  25 years later, a slightly greyer @dra27 stepped out on the stage of King\u2019s
  Hall at Newcastle University for what, for now at least2, would be his last performance
  of this great work3. As I write this in the 9 hour window of unemployment between
  finishing at the University of Cambridge and Tarides and commuting down to 2\xBD
  Devonshire Square to start at Jane Street, it\u2019s a new year and a change of
  course. the \u201C27\u201D wouldn\u2019t be allocated until the next October\_\u21A9
  never say never\u2026\_\u21A9 I\u2019ve never recorded the work, although I recorded
  Ach, bleibe doch from Himmelfahrtsoratorium BWV 11 with Musik Podium Stuttgart ten
  years ago, which is one of the source arias for the famous Agnus Dei of the mass\_\u21A9"
