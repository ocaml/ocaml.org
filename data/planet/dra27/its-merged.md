title: "It\u2019s merged!!"
description: As I was very happy to announce on Discuss on 12 December, OCaml is Relocatable!
  Today, the final piece of the puzzle was merged, which is the necessary support
  to allow opam to take advantage of all this to be able to clone switches instead
  of recompiling them. Before this, you could rename a local switch, for example,
  but opam would still be compiling them from scratch. The fruits of this continue
  to be available through my opam-repository fork, as announced in September, and
  will be available out-of-the-box for the first alpha release of OCaml 5.5 early
  next year.
