title: File descriptors are not integers
description: "There was a flurry of activity on ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring this month
  leading to a release (ocaml/opam-repository#28604). ocaml-uring provides bindings
  to the Linux\u2019s io_uring, which allows batching various syscalls to the kernel
  for it to execute out-of-order, and in parallel. Its principal use at the moment
  is for the high-performance Linux backend of Eio."
