<p>Last week I finally managed to slog through the last remaining issues required
to implement <cite>Virtual Libraries</cite>, and since it&rsquo;s quite a milestone (slated for
dune 1.7), I&rsquo;d like to share my excitement for this feature. The feature itself
is nothing new to old timers, but I think that dune now manages to present it in
a much more polished way. Besides, OCaml is enjoying a recent uptick of new
users, so perhaps a little review might be useful. I find that it is always
helpful to have at least a high level understanding of how a build feature works
to use it effectively.</p>
