<p>With dune 1.0 around the corner, there&rsquo;s a pressing need to <span class="strike">create some
hype</span> raise awareness of the upcoming features. In this post, I&rsquo;d like to talk
about one such transition: the move to dune&rsquo;s own configuration kit called
configurator. Since the library itself is still fairly new, I&rsquo;ll first introduce
configurator itself and show what problems it attempts to solve.</p>
