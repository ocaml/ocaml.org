<p>Now that 1.0.0 has been released, the team took a break from dune affairs.
However, now we&rsquo;re back to work, and although we&rsquo;re working at a more relaxed
pace, we still have some interesting features in store. Most of these were
already planned for quite a while, but simply had to be delayed to get 1.0.0 out
of the door. Hopefully this post convinces the reader that it was worth the
wait.</p>
