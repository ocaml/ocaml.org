<p>This will be a short PSA to opam package maintainers to avoid spurious optional
dependencies. At this point, I think this is all relatively common knowledge.
But open source maintainers are as a rule busy people, and without much
encouragement, they end up dragging their feet. Therefore I hope this post can
be a useful reminder of the negative effects of optional dependencies and what
can be done to avoid them.</p>
