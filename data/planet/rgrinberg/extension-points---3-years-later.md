<p>UPDATE: 2017-12-05 <a href="https://github.com/smondet" class="reference external">smondet</a> pointed out that the extension doesn&rsquo;t work quite as
the original. <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_getenv/" class="reference external">ppx_getenv</a> should fetch the environment variable at compile time
rather than at runtime. The extension and the snippets in this post have been
updated to reflect this.</p>
