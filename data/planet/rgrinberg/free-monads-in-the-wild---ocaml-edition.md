<p>OCaml programmers don&rsquo;t seem to resort to free monads much. I like to imagine
that this is the case because we&rsquo;re a practical bunch. But it could simply be
that this technique like other monads is a bit heavyweight syntactically, let
alone the performance implications it might have.</p>
