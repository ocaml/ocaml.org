<p>OCaml is my favorite language, but one area where it (its tools rather)
often falls short in practice is common string handling tasks where
regular expressions are often involved. The kind of stuff that Awk and
and scripting languages often get praised for. In other words, not
getting in the way and allowing to get the job done with minimal
boilerplate.</p>
