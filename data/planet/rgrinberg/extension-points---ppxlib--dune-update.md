<p>In a <a href="http://rgrinberg.com/posts/extension-points-3-years-later/#extension-points" class="reference internal"><span class="std std-ref">previous post</span></a>, I&rsquo;ve described what are the latest
technologies used to construct and package ppx rewriters. In just eight months a
couple important changes have occurred that require ppx authors to react. In
this post, I&rsquo;d like to describe these changes and demonstrate how to update your
ppx rewriters to keep up with them.</p>
