<p class="">More OCaml: Algorithms, Methods &amp; Diversions is now available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/More-OCaml-Algorithms-Methods-Diversions/dp/0957671113/">Amazon</a> at $39.99 or less, or as a DRM-free PDF eBook for $19.99 at <a href="http://ocaml-book.com/more-ocaml-algorithms-methods-diversions/">ocaml-book.com</a>, where you will also find sample chapters, and the exercises and examples to download.</p><p class="">Here's the blurb:</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">In&nbsp;<em>More OCaml</em>&nbsp;John Whitington takes a meandering tour of functional programming with OCaml, introducing various language features and describing some classic algorithms. The book ends with a large worked example dealing with the production of PDF files. There are questions for each chapter together with worked answers and hints.</p><p class=""><em>More OCaml</em>&nbsp;will appeal both to existing OCaml programmers who wish to brush up their skills, and to experienced programmers eager to explore functional languages such as OCaml. It is hoped that each reader will find something new, or see an old thing in a new light. For the more casual reader, or those who are used to a different functional language, a summary of basic OCaml is provided at the front of the book.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">If you buy the book, please do consider leaving a review on Amazon, which you can do even if you buy just the PDF eBook.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p>
