<p>I've made a few little tutorial videos to go with the book. Just seven for now, covering the first four chapters, but more to come:</p><ol><li>Evaluating an expression</li><li>True and false</li><li>Making decisions</li><li>Names and functions</li><li>Patterns</li><li>Lists</li><li>Take and drop</li><li>Appending two lists</li></ol><p>They're not really a substitute for the book but, when learning, it's always helpful to go over things twice, particularly using a different medium.</p><p>The videos are available <a href="http://ocaml-book.com/videos/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
