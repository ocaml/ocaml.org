<p>As of today I am on gardening leave, and I intend to spend the time productively (after taking a long-planned and well-deserved holiday next week!). In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update this blog more regularly, I have some posts that I have been meaning to write but just never have the time. I have been updating my <a href="http://gaiusdive.wordpress.com/">other blog</a> tho&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Some work on my sorely neglected Open Source stuff &ndash; finally LOBs in <a href="http://gaiustech.github.io/ociml/">OCI*ML</a>?? <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#128578;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/></li>
<li>Get properly up to speed in a couple of new technologies, mainly <a href="https://gaiustech.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/howto-install-oracle-12c-on-debian-wheezy/">Oracle 12c</a> and <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html">C++11</a>.</li>
<li>Repair the stack of broken <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/creative_economy/assets/features/bbc_micro">BBC Micros</a> in the living room!</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been offered redundancy before, and take a pretty philosophical view of it. I work for organizations, or groups within larger organizations, that push hard and take risks. When it works, it works very well &ndash; this year I got a decent bonus, despite the company struggling (a matter of public record, not betraying any secrets!). And when it doesn&rsquo;t, then it&rsquo;s time to go.</p>
