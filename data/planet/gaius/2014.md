<p>So, how was 2014 for me, in tech at least? Pretty good. It has been quite an interesting experience adapting to an all-proprietary tech stack (database, language, IDE, job scheduler) but I feel I am finally getting a grip on how all the moving parts hang together and how the sum is greater than the whole of the parts. So, professionally, I&rsquo;m pretty happy and I find out early next year how happy they are with me <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#128578;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/></p>
<p>The <code>systemd</code> farce has prompted me, after nearly 20 years, to look at alternatives to Debian for my personal Unix(-like). Candidates for a replacement so far are <a href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org/">DragonFly</a>, <a href="http://minix3.org/">Minix3</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/debian.html">Debian/HURD</a>, tho&rsquo; I have to wonder how viable the latter is. The Debian project simply doesn&rsquo;t have the manpower to maintain two parallel distros, once <code>systemd</code> has fully infected Linux. Windows 95 called, it wants its registry back. I have these running in VMs to kick the tyres right now. But more and more of my scarce time for personal projects is taken up with <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/30/bbc_micro_model_b_30th_anniversary/">BBC Micro</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari ST</a> stuff now anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>Speaking of the Beeb, <a href="http://www.elitedangerous.com/">Elite: Dangerous</a> is available now. I have to admit I was skeptical that it would ever ship, and I&rsquo;ll hold my hand up to say I was wrong about that, good work Braben. However I won&rsquo;t be playing. The lack of a single player mode is the deal breaker for me &ndash; you can play single-player but you are forced to participate in the shared universe, which runs in real time. But in a game I want the universe to stop when I&rsquo;m not there and resume where I left off whether that&rsquo;s an hour later or a month. And consider this: I bought my copy of the original Elite, in 1984, with pocket money I&rsquo;d saved. Acornsoft ceased to exist as a separate entity in 1986 as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/business/warner-sells-atari-to-tramiel.html">the bottom dropped out</a> of the home computer market. But I still play it in 2014, on original hardware. Should something happen to the servers owned and operated by Frontier, what happens to online-only Elite?</p>
<p>Nothing to report on the <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> front. I&rsquo;m still into it, but just haven&rsquo;t had time to do much on <a href="http://gaiustech.github.io/ociml/manpage.html">OCI*ML</a>. As I said previously, I had gotten it to the point at which it was useful for the work I was doing at the time. Features such as handling BLOBs are still outstanding, maybe I will have a chance to add that (and find a way to do it without my company claiming the IP). I&rsquo;d like to maintain my connection to the OCaml community, because you never know&hellip; And I need to get properly up to speed on <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/the-c14-standard-what-you-need-to-know/240169034">C++14</a>, again to keep options open. (<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/farewell-dr-dobbs/240169421">RIP Dr Dobbs</a>). Will I ever return to the world of Oracle? I won&rsquo;t rule it out but what I am doing now is a radically different way of thinking about databases and the applications that run on them; a few years of this can only strengthen my database and development career long term.</p>
<p>My prediction in wider tech in 2015 is this is the make-or-break year, either <em>something is done</em> about impossible-to-secure HTTP, SMTP and TCP/IP networks, or the public massively disengages from online services in general, sticking only to those websites with a) a good track record of security and b) an even better track record of making things right financially and logistically when their customers are impacted by a breach.</p>
