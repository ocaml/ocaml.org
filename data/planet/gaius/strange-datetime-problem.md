<p>While working on my unit tests, I came across a sporadic failure in inserting and selecting Datetimes to the database, so I wrote a quick test harness to see what&rsquo;s going on:</p>
<pre class="brush: fsharp; title: ; notranslate">
open Ociml
open Printf

let () = 
  let lda =  oralogon &quot;ociml_test/ociml_test&quot; in
  let sth = oraopen lda in
  for i = 0 to 100 do
    orasql sth &quot;truncate table test_date&quot;;
    let d = (Datetime (localtime (Random.float (time() *. 2.)))) in
    oraparse sth &quot;insert into test_date values (:1)&quot;;
    orabind sth (Pos 1) d;
    oraexec sth;
    oracommit lda;
    orasql sth &quot;select * from test_date&quot;;
    let rs = orafetch sth in
    match (rs.(0) = d) with
    |true -&gt; print_endline (sprintf &quot;Inserted %s, got %s, OK&quot; (orastring d) (orastring rs.(0)))
    |false -&gt; print_endline (sprintf &quot;Inserted %s, got %s &lt;-------- FAIL&quot; (orastring d) (orastring rs.(0)))
  done
</pre>
<p>This fails about 3% of the time, for reasons I cannot fathom, there seems to be no correlation with summer time. Here&rsquo;s a set of results incase anyone else can figure it out:</p>

<p>The only thing I can see is that they&rsquo;re near the Unix epoch, but why would that cause it to be exactly 1 hour out&hellip;? The latest version of the code is <a href="https://github.com/gaiustech/ociml">up on Github</a>. The underlying C code is in <code>oci_types.c</code>.</p>
<p>Anyway, at least this illustrates the value of soak-testing with randomly generated data &ndash; I had never experienced this issue &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo;, not has it been reported. </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Fixed! Was a double-application of <code>localtime</code>. I never noticed it because at the company I was at when I wrote this, there was a policy of all machines everywhere in the world being in GMT all year round! The epoch thing was a red herring. I suppose the moral of the story is make sure your random data is really random&hellip;</p>
