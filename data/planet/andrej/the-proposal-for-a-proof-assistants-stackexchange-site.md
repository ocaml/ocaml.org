<p>Proof assistant communities have grown quite a bit lately. They have active Zulip chats: <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Lean</a>, <a href="https://coq.zulipchat.com/">Coq</a>, <a href="https://agda.zulipchat.com/">Agda</a>, <a href="https://isabelle.zulipchat.com/">Isabelle</a>. These are good for discussions, but less so for knowledge accumulation and organization, and are not indexed by the search engines.</p>

<p>I have therefore created a <a href="https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/126242/proof-assistants?referrer=YjczN2ZjMzMyYWRkYjYwOTMzMzJhMjRmZDNiZDJkZGQ1ZGE4MzFiZWQ3YzRlMjYzMzdiMTMxZTBkOTg1ZWNkMdt2-If5yCiayS9kTjQT0iElh8l0mRnZ3CnkNXRmWJGq0">proposal for a new &ldquo;Proof assistants&rdquo;</a> StackExchange site. I believe that such a site would complement very well various Zulips dedicated to specific proof assistants. If you favor the idea, please support it by visiting the proposal and</p>

<ul>
  <li>becoming a follower (you have to be a registered user with a verified email account),</li>
  <li>asking sample questions, and</li>
  <li>upvoting good sample questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>To pass the first stage, we need 60 followers and 40 questions with at least 10 votes to proceed to the next stage.</p>
