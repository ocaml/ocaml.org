<p>I gave a talk &ldquo;Variations on Weihrauch degrees&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.viam.science.tsu.ge/cie2023/">Computability in Europe
2023</a>, which took place in Tbilisi, Georgia. The talk was a remote one,
unfortunately. I spoke about generalizations of Weihrauch degrees, a largely unexplored territory that seems to offer
many opportunities to explore new directions of research. I am unlikely to pursue them myself, but will gladly talk with
anyone who is interested in doing so.</p>
