<p>At <a href="https://types2023.webs.upv.es">TYPES 2023</a> I had the honor of giving an invited talk &ldquo;On Isomorphism Invariance and Isomorphism Reflection in Type Theory&rdquo; in which I discussed isomorphism reflection, which states that isomorphic types are judgementally equal. This strange principle is consistent, and it validates some fairly strange type-theoretic statements.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://math.andrej.com/asset/data/TYPES2023-Isomoprhism-invariance-and-reflection.pdf">the slides with speaker notes</a>.</p>
