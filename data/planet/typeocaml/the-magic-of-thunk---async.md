<p>Currently in post-production.</p>

<p>Sorry, I still haven't finished this post. </p>

<p>As this will be the last post in the <em>magic of thunk</em> series, I really don't want to just introduce the <em>Async</em> library and its API, as <a href="https://github.com/janestreet?query=async">janestreet@github</a> and <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/concurrent-programming-with-async.html">realworldocaml</a> have already done a pretty good job. </p>

<p>What I am looking for is the design of <em>Async</em> and the magic of <em>thunk</em> that hides inside its implementations. Since <em>Async</em> is sophisticated, it is a non-trivial task for me. I have to read the <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/async_kernel/tree/master/lib">source code</a> and it will take a while. </p>
