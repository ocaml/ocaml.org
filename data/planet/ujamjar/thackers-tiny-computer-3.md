<p>Thackers Tiny Computer 3 (TTC) is one in a series of simple RISC processor cores designed
by Chuck Thacker.  The implementation provided here is based on a
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/ECAD+Arch/labs/background/ttc.html">design</a> 
by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~swm11/">Simon Moore</a> and friends
at Cambridge University.  We give a brief description of the CPU core and assembler
and provide an online simulator for the CPU.</p>
