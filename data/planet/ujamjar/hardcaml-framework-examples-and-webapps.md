<p><a href="https://github.com/ujamjar/hardcaml-examples">hardcaml-examples</a> 
provides a small framework for creating <a href="https://github.com/ujamjar/hardcaml">HardCaml</a> 
based cores and six example designs.  The framework code provides the general plumbing
required to create a console based application with features including code generation, 
simulation, and waveform viewing.  A recent update extends the framework so that cores
can be run on a webpage.</p>
