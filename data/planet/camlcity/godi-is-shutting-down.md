  <b>Sorry!</b><br/>&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  
Unfortunately, it is no longer possible for me to run the GODI
distribution. GODI will not upgrade to OCaml 4.01 once it is out,
and it will shut down the public service in the course of September 2013.

</div>

<div>
  
<p>This website, camlcity.org, will remain up, but with reduced
content. Existing GODI installations can be continued to be used,
but upgrades or bugfixes will not be available when GODI is off.

</p><p>
Although there are still a lot of GODI users, it is unavoidable
to shut GODI down due to lack of supporters, especially package
developers. I was more or less alone in the past months, and my
time contingent will not allow it to do the upgrade to OCaml 4.01
alone (when it is released).

</p><p>
Also, there was a lot of noise about a competing packaging system
for OCaml in the past weeks: OPAM. Apparently, it got a lot of
attention both from individuals and from organizations. As I see
it, the OCaml community is too small to support two systems, and
so in some sense GODI is displaced by OPAM.

</p><p>
The sad part is that OPAM is only clearly better in one point,
namely in interacting with the community (via Github). In times
where social networks are worth billions this is probably the
striking point. It doesn't matter that OPAM lacks
some features GODI has.
So there is some loss of functionality for the community
(partly difficult to replace, like GODI's support for Windows).

</p><p>
If somebody wants to take over GODI, please do so. The 
<a href="https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/godi-bootstrap/">source code</a>
is still available as well as the 
<a href="https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/godi-build/">package directories</a>.
Maybe it is sufficient to move the repository to a public place and to
redesign the package release process to give GODI a restart.
