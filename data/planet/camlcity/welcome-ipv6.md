For two weeks the camlcity.org website is fully connected to IPv6.

</div>

<div>
  
<p>
Actually, the raw connectivity exists already for more than two years,
but I haven't found time to put the IP addresses into DNS. This is now
done, making the site visible.
</p>

<p>
Around 1% of the traffic is now via IPv6. This is way more than I was
expecting. Here in Germany, only a few Internet providers have already
rolled out IPv6, but the major players are planning it for 2014. It
turns out that at home I already have IPv6, although only via
DSLite. (NB. In the default DNS configuration a client connected with
DSLite or other 6-in-4 technologies will pick the IPv4 address if both
&quot;Internets&quot; are available, so such clients will not show up in my web
server logs as IPv6.)
</p>

<p>
The IPv6 world is different: no NAT anymore, and every computer
has a globally routable address. This is something you need to get
used to - the Internet appears again as a real peer-to-peer
network as in the first years, and the distinction between client
and datacenter connectivity is gone. Let's hope this drives
innovation - like user-controlled social networks, for instance.
