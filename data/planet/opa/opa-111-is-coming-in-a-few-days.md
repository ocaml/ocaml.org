This is a short update to tell that the Opa 1.1.1 release is finally around the corner as we are building packages. Of course, if you're impatient, you can build from <a href="https://github.com/MLstate/opalang/commits/master">sources</a>.&nbsp;The release brings back the compatibility with the latest releases of NodeJS, now recommending the latest 0.10.3 version.<br/>
<br/>
Since our last blog posts detailed what's new in Opa, many things have changed and have been updated:<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Foreign-function calls are easier than ever and Opa now supports npm.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Another major feature is the support of Postgres, our first supported SQL database. Switching your runtime from MongoDB to Postgres is extremely easy.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br/>
We also will try to keep the blog updated a bit more often, expect at least a major post monthly. If you want to share with the Opa community what you are building, <a href="mailto:contact@opalang.org">contact us</a> to submit a guest post.<br/>
<br/>
And as a reminder, you can order the Opa book from its publisher O'Reilly or Amazon, which is the best resource to learn the technology.<br/>
<br/>
See you soon!
