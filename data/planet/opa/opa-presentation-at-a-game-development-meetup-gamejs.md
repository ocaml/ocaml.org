<div class="paragraph"><p>Our founder, Henri, presented Opa recently at a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/gamesjs">Game meetup in San Francisco</a>. This was a great opportunity for Opa to be presented to a new audience. The on-line gaming world is faced with the challenge of the demise of Flash and there is a need to find a new programming language and platform to deliver the best on-line gaming experience in HTML5.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Why would you want to use Opa for writing games? Well, for a number of reasons:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Opa is high-level and very concise. That means that, once you're fluent in it, you can make things happen <em>real</em> fast. This increased productivity is very important for games, where you often need to experiment, prototype and evaluate many different approaches.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Real-time communication with the server and between the players is a must in interactive, multi-player games. Opa's sessions make it as easy as it gets to set-up this kind of communication (I'll try to talk more about that in one of the upcoming technical posts).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Games are not the easiest type of software to write: highly interactive, distributed among multiple-players, often involving intricate logic&hellip; Things are complex enough as it is, so why not get a boost of a strongly-typed language that will detect big part of programming mistakes already at compilation time?
</p>
