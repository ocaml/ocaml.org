<div class="paragraph"><p>Hey Opa coders! I do realize the blog was a bit low on tutorials lately. The problem is: writing them is very time-consuming and with so much stuff happening around Opa lately (just last week: very successful Opa DevCamp in Paris plus presence at <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">GDC 2012</a>, biggest gaming conference, in San Francisco, CA) it's sometimes difficult to keep up.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, we get a continuous stream of interesting questions, via the <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/opa">mailing list</a>, <a href="http://forum.opalang.org">forum</a> and otherwise. Many of those questions are of general interest and some of them are nicely self-contained. Such as today's question from Nathan Frund (private communication) who was wondering how best to map HTML's SELECT component to Opa. Perfect subject for a short HOWTO!&hellip; so that's how <a href="https://github.com/akoprow/OpaHOWTOs">OpaHOWTOs</a> were born :).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The idea is to take certain tasks/problems and to illustrate how to address them properly in Opa. Instead of writing a full-blown tutorial I just write a simple demo program: heavily commented, with HINTs and EXERCISEs. The nice thing about this is that even if you're not interested in the subject itself of a particular HOWTO, they should often contain techniques and solutions that are of general interest, so you can still learn!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://github.com/akoprow/OpaHOWTOs">Check out</a> the freshly created repo. I may occasionally post some updates about it on the blog, but the best way to stay updated and hear about them is to follow us on Twitter:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Oh, one more thing: if you have good HOWTOs ideas don't hesitate to share them with me! (for instance in the comments to this post).</p></div>
