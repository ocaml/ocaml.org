As many of you know, the main source to learn Opa is the O'Reilly book: <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025436.do">Opa, Up and Running</a>*.<br/>
<br/>
One of the highlight of the book is a walk-through the development of Birdy, a micro-blogging platform, aka. mini-Twitter.<br/>
<br/>
What was missing until now was the availability of the app as an open source project. Done! <a href="https://github.com/MLstate/birdy">Birdy</a> is now an open source project released under the MIT license.<br/>
<br/>
You are welcome to fork the project and add features, as the expressiveness of Opa surely allows to develop a full-featured platform quickly.<br/>
<br/>
As a bonus, at a time where security of applications becomes increasingly important as organizations and governments spy on each other, Opa should provide a pretty good security level by default. As Opa is an official OWASP project, expect some related news in this domain next.<br/>
