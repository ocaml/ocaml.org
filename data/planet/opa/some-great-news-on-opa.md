<p>It's been a while since our last post. Like many others, we mainly rely on Twitter to spread the news on Opa.</p><p>This very short post is just an exciting summary on new things that happened in the last couple of months.</p><h1>Release of Opa 1.1.0</h1><p>We released Opa 1.1.0 which as always brings bugfixes, performance enhancement and new feature.</p><p>With Opa 1.1.0, you now can include JavaScript code and Node.js packages easier than ever! We will write about it soon.</p><p>Sadly, we were hit by GitHub decision to halt its download feature. We relied on this and even built a service (in Opa!) that automatically pushed packages. We are still looking at nice hosting alternatives, as the GitHub files should disappear soon.</p><p>From this release, we also support a 32-bit Windows package.</p><h1>Ongoing support of Postgres</h1><p>For a important project that is being built with Opa, we are adding Postgres support.</p><p>Switching your Opa code from MongoDB to Postgres requires almost no code change, and again we will write about it soon.</p><h1>Big project in Opa</h1><p>As mentioned earlier, we are working on a pretty big project implemented with Opa. Stay tuned!</p>
