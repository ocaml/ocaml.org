<p>[OCaML'23] Buck2 for OCaml Users &amp; Developers</p>
<p>Shayne Fletcher, Neil Mitchell</p>
<p>Buck2 is an open-source large scale build system used by thousands of developers at Meta every day. Buck2 can be used to build OCaml with some useful advantages over alternatives (e.g. Dune or Bazel). In this talk weâ€™ll discuss what those advantages are, why they arise, and how to use Buck2 for your OCaml development.</p>
