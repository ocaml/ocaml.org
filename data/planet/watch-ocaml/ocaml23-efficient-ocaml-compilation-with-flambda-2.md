<p>[OCaML'23] Efficient OCaml compilation with Flambda 2</p>
<p>Pierre Chambart, Vincent LAVIRON, Mark Shinwell</p>
<p>Flambda 2 is an IR and optimisation pass for OCaml centred around inlining. We discuss the engineering constraints that shaped it and the overall structure that allows the compiler to be fast enough to handle very large industrial code bases.</p>
