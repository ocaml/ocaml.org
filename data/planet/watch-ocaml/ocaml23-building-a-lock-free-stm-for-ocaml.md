<p>[OCaML'23] Building a lock-free STM for OCaml</p>
<p>Vesa Karvonen, Bartosz Modelski, Carine Morel, Thomas Leonard, KC Sivaramakrishnan, YSS Narasimha Naidu, Sudha Parimala</p>
<p>The kcas library was originally developed to provide a primitive atomic lock-free multi-word compare-and-set operation. This talk introduces kcas and discusses the recent development of kcas turning it into a proper lock-free software transactional memory implementation for OCaml that provides composable transactions, scheduler friendly modular blocking, and comes with a companion library of composable lock-free data structures.</p>
