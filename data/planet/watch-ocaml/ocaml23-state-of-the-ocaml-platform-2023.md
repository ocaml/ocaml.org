<p>[OCaML'23] State of the OCaml Platform 2023</p>
<p>Thibaut Mattio, Anil Madhavapeddy, Thomas Gazagnaire, David Allsopp</p>
<p>This paper reflects on a decade of progress and developments within the OCaml Platform, from its inception in 2013 with the release of opam 1.0, to today where it stands as a robust toolchain for OCaml developers. We review the last three years in detail, emphasizing the advancements and innovations that have shaped the OCaml development landscape and highlighting key milestones such as the migration to Dune as the primary build system, and the development of a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for OCaml.<br>
We also outline our plan for the coming years. The roadmap is informed by community feedback, discussions with Platform tool maintainers, and insights from industrial users of OCaml. The final version of this evolving roadmap, designed to shape the future of the OCaml developer experience, will be presented at the International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP).</p>
