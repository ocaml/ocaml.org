<p>[OCaML'23] Parallel Sequences in Multicore OCaml</p>
<p>Andrew Tao</p>
<p>I present my implementation of a parallel sequences abstraction that utilizes the support for shared memory parallelism in the new OCaml 5.0.0 multicore runtime. This abstraction allows clients to create highly parallelizable programs without needing to write, or even understand, the low-level implementation details necessary to parallelize large tasks.</p>
