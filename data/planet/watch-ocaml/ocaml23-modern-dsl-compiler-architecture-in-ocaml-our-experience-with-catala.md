<p>[OCaML'23] Modern DSL compiler architecture in OCaml our experience with Catala</p>
<p>Louis Gesbert, Denis Merigoux</p>
<p>In this presentation, we intend to show a state-of-the-art DSL implementation in OCaml, with concrete examples and experience reports.<br>
In particular, we found that some advanced practices, while accepted among the hardcore OCaml developers (e.g. use of row type variables through object types), lacked visibility and documentation: some of them deserve to be better known.<br>
Our experience is based on the Catala compiler, a DSL for the implementation of algorithms defined in law.</p>
