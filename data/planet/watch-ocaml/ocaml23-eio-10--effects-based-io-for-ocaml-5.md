<p>[OCaML'23] Eio 1.0 – Effects-based IO for OCaml 5</p>
<p>Thomas Leonard, Patrick Ferris, Christiano Haesbaert, Lucas Pluvinage, Vesa Karvonen, Sudha Parimala, KC Sivaramakrishnan, Vincent Balat, Anil Madhavapeddy</p>
<p>Eio provides an effects-based direct-style IO stack for OCaml 5. This talk introduces Eio’s main features, such as use of effects, multi-core support and lock-free data-structures, support for modular programming, interoperability with other concurrency libraries such as Lwt, Async and Domainslib, and interactive monitoring support enabled by the custom runtime events in OCaml 5.1. We will report on our experiences porting existing applications to Eio.</p>
