<p>[OCaML'23] MetaOCaml Theory and Implementation</p>
<p>Oleg Kiselyov</p>
<p>Quasi-quotation (or, code templates) has long been used as a convenient tool for code generation, commonly implemented as a pre-processing/translation into code-generation combinators. The original MetaOCaml was also based on such translation, done post type checking. BER MetaOCaml employs a significantly different, efficient (especially in version N114) translation integrated with type-checking, in the least intrusive way. This paper presents the integrated efficient translation for the first time.</p>
