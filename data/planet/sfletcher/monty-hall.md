<p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors : Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No.3 which has a goat. He then says to you, &quot;Do you want to pick door No. 2?&quot; Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>This problem is known as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall</a>&quot; problem. It's named after the host of the American television game show &quot;Let's make a deal&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erd&#337;s</a>, one of the most prolific mathematicians in history remained unconvinced (of the correct answer to the above problem) until he was shown a computer simulation confirming the predicted result.</p>

<p>
Here's a simulation in OCaml one hopes, may have convinced Paul!
