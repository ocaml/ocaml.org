[Update:<a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/teaching-ocaml.html" target="_blank"> The Ocaml teaching resource page</a> is now live] <br/>
<br/>
I am helping the folks behind <a href="http://ocaml.org/">OCaml.org</a> with setting up a page that will useful resources for educators that want to teach OCaml to masses.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking to include helpful guides on how to setup a development environment, provide links to useful VMs as well as list some tips for complete beginners. There is a lot of material on the web, however it is scattered all over the places and sometimes hard to find. We will try to find the best of the lot and have them referenced in one place.<br/>
<br/>
Watch this space...I really meant <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/OCAML-Teaching-Resources" target="_blank">this space</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We are also listing all the universities where OCaml is being taught.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if we missed any.<br/>
<br/>
It is great to<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/view?mid=zk8_K4G_usic.kkzYvEvqV44Q" target="_blank"> see them on the Google maps</a> as well :)<br/>
