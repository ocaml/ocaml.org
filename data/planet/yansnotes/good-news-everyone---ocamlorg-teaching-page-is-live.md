I am helping out with a great initiative to create a <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/teaching-ocaml.html" target="_blank">Ocaml teaching page </a>containing resources for anyone who would like to teach Ocaml.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
The initial page is now up, however the work is far from over. <br/>
<br/>
We would like to open it to the community to contribute any additional resources that we might have missed as well as providing feedback on the currently listed resources.<br/>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<br/></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
The best way to do that is by editing this <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/OCAML-Teaching-Resources" target="_blank">wiki page</a> or <a href="https://github.com/yansh/ocaml.org/blob/master/site/learn/teaching-ocaml.md" target="_blank">editing the page itself </a>and creating a pull request.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Mailing list for teachers</b> <br/>
<br/></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
We also created <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching" target="_blank">a mailing list</a> for the teachers to exchange their experiences and common practices.<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to hearing from you!</div>
