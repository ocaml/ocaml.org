<p>Finally the first official release of <strong>ODNS</strong> and <strong>ring</strong> is here!</p>
<p>Get a look at the <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/doc/dns/html/">API documentation</a>, the <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/odns/documentation/">tutorial for ODNS</a> (not finished), the documentation of the associated <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/ring/documentation/">DNS lookup tool, ring</a>, or simply <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/download/">download this new release</a>.</p>
<p>If you find any bug on either the API or &ldquo;ring&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t hesitate to fill a <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/bugs/">bug report</a>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any release note is really necessary as this is the first real release anyway, so everything should be new to anyone. The best would then be to watch at the associated documentations I linked before, and then get your own idea of what you can do with this API library or this DNS lookup tool.</p>
<p>And thank you to the <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/about/">original authors</a> (Guillaume Valadon and Emmanuel Letellier), thanks to whom I have been able to begin working on this library on good bases.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
