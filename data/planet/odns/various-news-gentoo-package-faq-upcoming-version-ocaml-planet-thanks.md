<p>Hi,</p>
<p>at first I wanted to write several tickets, but I had so many topics that I thought I should compile them together.</p>
<h3>Gentoo and Funtoo packages</h3>
<p>So the other day, I sent emails on some mailing lists to announce ODNS version 0.2. And something like the following day, I notice several links from <a href="http://gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a> related websites referencing ODNS&rsquo;s website. So it just took about a single day for a Gentoo contributor to make a <a href="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/dev-ml/odns">package for ODNS</a>! As a long time user of Gentoo myself, I was really pleased and never stops to be impressed by this distribution, its users and ecosystem.<br/>
Also I would like to thank <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/author/aballier">Alexis Ballier</a> who made the package.<br/>
It seems the same package is also available on <a href="http://docs.funtoo.org/wiki/Docs.funtoo.org">Funtoo Linux</a>, which describes itself as a <em>Gentoo Linux variant</em> (it has a different portage tree, but apparently all packages are imported, though often with changes). I didn&rsquo;t even know this distribution before!<br/>
Hence I updated the <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/download">download page</a> with these information.</p>
<p>If anyone made a package for another distribution, don&rsquo;t hesitate to tell me!</p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>I created a <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/odns/faq/">Frequently Asked Question</a> page, because a few questions got asked to me on the <a href="https://sympa-roc.inria.fr/wws/info/caml-list">Caml mailing list</a>, in particular about the license (once in private, once on the list) and whether the library was synchroneous. This point in particular is interesting so I plan to later write an article here about the interests of both synchroneous and asynchroneous development, and why I chose synchroneous, though both systems have interests and issues.</p>
<h3>Soon-to-come version 0.3!</h3>
<p>Yes you read well. I already plan a 0.3. Actually I would have already got it out if I was not moving a lot at the moment. I have already many changes and improvements (very interesting ones, at least I think), to both the library and the lookup tool, like a nice caching system&hellip; but not only! Stay tuned.</p>
<h3>OCaml planet</h3>
<p>I got proposed to add this news feed to the <a href="http://planet.ocamlcore.org/">OCaml planet</a> hosted by the <a href="http://www.ocamlcore.com">OCamlCore</a> company. So I accepted. Now if you already follow this planet, then you will get news from ODNS as well. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#128578;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/></p>
<h3>Thanks!</h3>
<p>Many thanks to all the people who showed interest (and even those who didn&rsquo;t show it, but had some anyway) to ODNS and ring.<br/>
And also I would like to thank INRIA&rsquo;s <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/cgi-bin/hump.cgi">hump</a> and <a href="http://links.camlcity.org/frames.html">CamlCity</a> for linking the project in their OCaml software database.<br/>
And a special thanks to <a href="http://tuxfamily.org">TuxFamily</a>, the host for this website, the archive, the code repository, the mailing list, and basically everything. This is a small community service and the admins are always nice and great to answer emails (though I never met them personally and don&rsquo;t know them at all) very fast and taking care of every worries I always showed. So I think they deserve special thanks. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#128578;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/></p>
<p>See you all.</p>
