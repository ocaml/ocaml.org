<p>Yeah so now there is a <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/bugs">bug tracker</a> included in my <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> instance (basically the software which makes this website). I first tried to install a full-featured bug tracker and project management tool (<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>) but it was a pain in the ass to install (though the software itself is pretty nice for the time I had to use it as a simple user). I mean in particular, it was not easy and I didn&rsquo;t want to spend hours.</p>
<p>So I found this nice WordPress plugin called &ldquo;<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bug-library/">bug library</a>&ldquo;. Obviously it is missing a lot of features compared to bug tracker projects on their own; but for the few minutes I have played with, it still looks nice and probably sufficient for this project (though for my bigger projects, I may probably use more complete trackers).<br/>
So I&rsquo;ll keep this for now unless I see big problems with it in the future.</p>
<p>Soon will be the first official release, keep updated!</p>
