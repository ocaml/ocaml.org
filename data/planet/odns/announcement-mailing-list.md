<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have created a small mailing list for the project. This is NOT a discussion list. I don&rsquo;t think such a project needs a discussion list (we can discuss bugs and features by making reports and requests in the <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/bugs">bug tracker</a>). This is only a &ldquo;diffusion&rdquo; list: to announce important stuffs, like releases. In other words, I am the only one able to publish on the list.</p>
<p>It means you won&rsquo;t receive any spams from this list and also that this is a very low volume list (very few messages) but that&rsquo;s good to keep informed of the project&rsquo;s development, because obviously you are not going to come on this website all the time (for RSS addicts, RSS is a <a href="http://odns.tuxfamily.org/feed/">good tool for keeping updated</a> too).</p>
