<p>It's Spring, and time for the thirteenth Cambridge OCaml compiler-hacking evening! We'll be back in <a href="http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/">Pembroke College</a> again, in the centre of Cambridge.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pembroke1347/status/729615893425225728?lang=en-gb"><img src="http://ocamllabs.io/compiler-hacking/imgs/pembroke-spring.jpg" alt="Pembroke"/></a></p>

<p>If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could <a href="http://doodle.com/poll/qx649tkmmq7kg5u4">indicate interest via Doodle</a> and <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/cam-compiler-hacking">sign up to the mailing list</a> to receive updates.</p>

<p><em><strong>Where</strong></em>: N7, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Pembroke+College/@52.2018741,0.1177328,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870a2a3162b45:0x178705666a5d2498">Pembroke College</a>, Cambridge CB2 1RF. Head through the entrance on Trumpington Street, and turn left straight after the Porters Lodge.</p>

<p><em><strong>When</strong></em>: 7pm, Tuesday 31st May.</p>

<p><em><strong>Who</strong></em>: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>What</strong></em>: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals</p>

<p><em><strong>Wiki</strong></em>: https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki</p>

<p>We're defining &quot;compiler&quot; pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the
 <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/stdlib">standard library</a>,
 <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun">run</a><a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/asmrun">time</a>, tools
    (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html">ocamldep</a>,
     <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html">ocamllex</a>,
     <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html">ocamlyacc</a>, etc.), the
 <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/debugger.html">debugger</a>, the
 <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/manual">documentation</a>, and the
 <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml">compiler</a> itself. We'll have
 <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">suggestions for mini-projects</a> for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.</p>

<p>We've arranged a self-service buttery dinner at 6:30pm - please head to the buttery when you arrive and help yourself to the food choices available. You can then bring your dinner to the Old Library (just next door) to sit down and eat.</p>
