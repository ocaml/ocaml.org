<p>Our next OCaml Compiler Hacking event will be on Thursday 7th December in The Thomas Gray Room at Pembroke College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/khqk6i49r4828apu">indicate interest via Doodle</a> and <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/cam-compiler-hacking">sign up to the mailing list</a> to receive updates.</p>

<p><em><strong>When</strong></em>: Thursday 7 December 2017, 19:00 - 22:30</p>

<p><em><strong>Where</strong></em>: The Thomas Gray Room, Pembroke College, Cambridge CB2 1RF</p>

<p><em><strong>Who</strong></em>: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>Refreshments</strong></em>: Finger buffet in hack room.</p>

<p><em><strong>What</strong></em>: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals</p>

<p><em><strong>Wiki</strong></em>: https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki</p>

<p>This hack evening focuses on fixing up opam packages as well as work on the OCaml compiler.</p>

<p>The OCaml 4.06 release featured safe-string as the default rather than optional as per previous releases. The focus of this event will be to work on the opam repository to fix up as many packages as possible, and also to publish a guide on <a href="http://ocamllabs.io/">ocamllabs.io</a> detailing how to migrate your packages for wider use.</p>

<p>The evening will also feature a short (5-10 min) presentation about recent <a href="http://marrakech2017.mirage.io/">MirageOS Marrakech Hack Retreat</a>.&#8203;</p>
