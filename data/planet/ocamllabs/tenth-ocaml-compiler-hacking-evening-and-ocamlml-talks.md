<p>We'll be meeting in the Computer Lab next Friday (28th August 2015) for another evening of compiler hacking.  All welcome!</p>

<p>We'll also be having an afternoon of OCaml- and ML-related talks beforehand, with titles suspiciously similar to talks at the <a href="http://www.mlworkshop.org/ml2015/">ML Workshop</a> and <a href="https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2015/">OCaml Workshop</a> the following week.</p>

<p>If you're planning to come along to either the talks or to compiler hacking, please <strong><a href="http://doodle.com/82arpxipidgqbvwi">add yourself to the Doodle poll</a></strong>.  Further updates, if any, will be posted to the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking">compiler hacking mailing list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Who</strong>: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.</p>

<p><strong>What</strong>: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals.</p>

<p>We're defining &quot;compiler&quot; pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/libref/index.html">standard library</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual024.html">runtime</a>, tools (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/depend.html">ocamldep</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc105">ocamllex</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc107">ocamlyacc</a>, etc.), <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual032.html">ocamlbuild</a>, the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/index.en.html">documentation</a>, and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">mini-projects</a> for various levels of experience (see also some <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-previously-worked-on">things we've done on previous evenings</a>), but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.</p>
