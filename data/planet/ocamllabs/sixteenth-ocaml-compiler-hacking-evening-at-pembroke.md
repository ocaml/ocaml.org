<p>Happy New Year! Our first compiler hacking event of 2017 will be at Pembroke College.</p>

<p>If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could <a href="http://doodle.com/poll/vgh3nq2q5wgnsi5y">indicate interest via Doodle</a> and <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/cam-compiler-hacking">sign up to the mailing list</a> to receive updates.</p>

<p><em><strong>Where</strong></em>: N7 Pembroke College<br/>
Cambridge&#8203;<br/>
CB2 1RF  </p>

<p>N7 is through the second arch and on the left.</p>

<p><em><strong>When</strong></em>: 630pm, Tuesday 7th February</p>

<p><em><strong>Who</strong></em>: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>What</strong></em>: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals</p>

<p>Refreshments: either the Pembroke buttery between 545-645pm (cash only) or there will be a finger buffet in N7 itself.</p>

<p>We're defining &quot;compiler&quot; pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the
 <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/stdlib">standard library</a>,
 <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun">run</a><a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/asmrun">time</a>, tools
    (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html">ocamldep</a>,
     <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html">ocamllex</a>,
     <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html">ocamlyacc</a>, etc.), the
 <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/debugger.html">debugger</a>, the
 <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/manual">documentation</a>, and the
 <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml">compiler</a> itself. We'll have
 <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">suggestions for mini-projects</a> for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.</p>
