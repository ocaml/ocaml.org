<p>For the seventh Cambridge OCaml compiler-hacking session we'll be meeting at <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=101%20Cambridge%20Science%20Park%20Milton%20Road,%20Cambridge&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.232955,0.150338&amp;spn=0.003082,0.006947&amp;sll=52.231717,0.144648&amp;sspn=0.012327,0.027788&amp;oq=101Cambrideg%20Science&amp;t=h&amp;hq=101%20Cambridge%20Science%20Park%20Milton%20Road,&amp;hnear=Cambridge,%20United%20Kingdom&amp;z=18">the Citrix office in the Cambridge Science Park</a> on 6.30pm Friday 1st August.  Thanks to Citrix for supporting and hosting the session!</p>

<p>We'll kick off with a demo from <a href="https://github.com/def-lkb">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bour</a> of modular implicits, an OCaml extension that adds support for overloading.</p>

<p>If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could <a href="http://doodle.com/46f2bnk4xny724in"><strong>indicate interest via Doodle</strong></a> and <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking">sign up to the mailing list</a> to receive updates:</p>

<p><strong>When</strong>: 6.30pm, Friday 1st August</p>

<p><strong>Who</strong>: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.</p>

<p><strong>What</strong>: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals</p>

<p><strong>Wiki</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki">https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki</a></p>

<p>We're defining &quot;compiler&quot; pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/libref/index.html">standard library</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual024.html">runtime</a>, tools (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/depend.html">ocamldep</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc105">ocamllex</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc107">ocamlyacc</a>, etc.), <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual032.html">ocamlbuild</a>, the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/index.en.html">documentation</a>, and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">mini-projects</a> for various levels of experience (see also some <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-previously-worked-on">things we've worked on in previous sessions</a>), but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.</p>

<p>We'll also be ordering pizza, so if you want to be counted for food you should aim to arrive by 6.45pm.</p>
