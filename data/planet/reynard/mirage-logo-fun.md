<p>With the new MirageOS 3.0 release on the horizon I looked at some ideas for a new logo. It will be a shame to lose our well-loved llama but it&rsquo;s also a great time for a new shiny logo!</p>

<p>I wanted the design to evoke the blurry appearance of a mirage, and also incorporate the &lsquo;M&rsquo;. The bright blue of the desert sky is a pleasing complement to the OCaml orange.</p>

<p>After talking with Anil, we thought it might interesting to have the logo also represent phases of completion or development, so I designed a hand drawn &lsquo;draft image for stage 1, a half coloured image for stage 2, and a complete image for the final stage.</p>

<p>They could potentially be used as badges for builds passing CI, or for Mirage libraries at different levels of development etc.</p>

<p>Still a work in progress - let me know what you think! @gemmag</p>
