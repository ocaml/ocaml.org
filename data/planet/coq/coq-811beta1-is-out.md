<p>The <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/tag/V8.11+beta1">first
beta release of Coq 8.11</a> is available for testing.</p>

<p>There are two main changes brought by Coq version 8.11.
First, it introduces Ltac2, a new tactic language for writing more robust larger scale
tactics, with built-in support for datatypes and the multi-goal tactic monad.
Second, primitive floats are integrated in terms and follow the binary64 format
of the IEEE 754 standard, as specified in the `Coq.Float.Floats` library.
Many other cleanups and improvements have been performed and are further described in
the <a href="https://coq.github.io/doc/v8.11/refman/changes.html#version-8-11">reference manual</a>.
</p>

<p>Feedback and <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/issues">bug
reports</a> are extremely welcome.</p>
