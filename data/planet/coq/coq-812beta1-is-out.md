<p>We are happy to announce the <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/tag/V8.12+beta1">first
beta release of Coq 8.12</a>.

</p><p>This new version integrates many usability improvements, in
particular to notations, scopes and implicit arguments, along with
many bug fixes and major improvements to the reference manual. See the
<a href="https://coq.github.io/doc/v8.12/refman/changes.html#version-8-12">changelog</a>
for details.

</p><p>As usual, we are looking for <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/issues">feedback from beta
testers</a>.  In addition, we are looking for beta readers of the <a href="https://coq.github.io/doc/v8.12/refman/">updated reference
manual</a>.

</p><p>The 8.12 improvements to the reference manual are the start of an
effort to improve Coq documentation.  We believe the documentation
needs considerable work to better serve the needs of the Coq
community.  Better documentation will encourage more people to learn,
teach and use Coq.  We need your help for this.  We're looking for
volunteers who will help rewrite or add new material (such as better
explanations and new examples) to the new pages. Writers do not have
to be experts on their topic: we can pair writers with experts that
can answer questions and provide examples. Indeed, it's a great way to
learn more about Coq.  We'd also appreciate specific feedback, perhaps
detailed, on what needs to be improved, what's missing and what things
to improve first.  If you are willing to help, please see the <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Refman-improvements-in-8.12-and-beyond">dedicated
wiki page</a> to learn more.
