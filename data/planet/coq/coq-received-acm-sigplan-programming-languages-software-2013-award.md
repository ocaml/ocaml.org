<p>The development of Coq has been initiated in 1984 at INRIA by Thierry Coquand and G&eacute;rard Huet, then joined by Christine Paulin-Mohring and more than 40 direct <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/who-did-what-in-coq">contributors</a>.</p>
<p>The first public release was CoC 4.10 in 1989. Extended with native inductive types, it was renamed Coq in 1991.</p>
<p>Since then, a growing community of users has shared its enthousiasm in the originality of the concepts of Coq and of its various features, as a richly-typed programming language and as an interactive theorem prover.</p>
