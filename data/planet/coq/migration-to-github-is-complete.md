<p>After several years of using GitHub specifically for its pull request system,
the Coq development team has migrated the
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/issues">Coq bug tracker</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki">Cocorico, the Coq wiki</a>
to GitHub as well.</p>

<p>More information about the migration of the Coq bug tracker may be found in this
<a href="https://www.theozimmermann.net/2017/10/bugzilla-to-github/">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>More information about the migration of Cocorico, the Coq wiki, may be found on this
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/WikiMigration">wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the GitHub repository is now the repository we push to
(as opposed to a mirror). Make sure that your git clone is tracking
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq">https://github.com/coq/coq.git</a>
to be always up-to-date.</p>
