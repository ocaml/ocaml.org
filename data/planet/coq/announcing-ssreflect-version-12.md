<p>The Mathematical Components Team, at the Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Center released a new version of Ssreflect, an powerful extension for Coq. For more information, read the official announcement:</p>
<p>&laquo;<br/>
We are pleased to announce the new release of the Ssreflect<br/>
extension library for the Coq proof assistant, version<br/>
8.2/8.2pl1. This release includes:<br/>
- an update of the tactic language which complies with the new version<br/>
  of Coq;<br/>
- an update of the combinatoric libraries distributed in the previous<br/>
  release of ssreflect;<br/>
- a new set of libraries for abstract algebra.</p>
<p>The name Ssreflect stands for &quot;small scale reflection&quot;, a style of<br/>
proof that evolved from the computer-checked proof of the Four Colour<br/>
Theorem and which leverages the higher-order nature of Coq's<br/>
underlying logic to provide effective automation for many small,<br/>
clerical proof steps. This is often accomplished by restating<br/>
(&quot;reflecting&quot;) problems in a more concrete form, hence the name. For<br/>
example, in the Ssreflect library arithmetic comparison is not an<br/>
abstract predicate, but a function computing a boolean.</p>
<p>Along with documentation, also available at<br/>
<a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00258384" title="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00258384">https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00258384</a> the Ssreflect distribution<br/>
comprises two parts:<br/>
- A new tactic language, which promotes more structured, concise and<br/>
  robust proof scripts, and is in fact independent from the &quot;reflection&quot;<br/>
  proof style. It is implemented as a linkable extension to the Coq<br/>
  system.<br/>
- A set of Coq libraries that provide core &quot;reflection-oriented&quot;<br/>
  theories for<br/>
  + basic combinatorics: arithmetic, lists, graphs, and finite sets.<br/>
  + abstract algebra: an algebraic hierarchy from<br/>
    additive groups to closed fields, polynomials, matrix,<br/>
    basic finite group theory, infrastructure for finite summations,...)</p>
<p>Some features of the tactic language:<br/>
- It provides tacticals for most structural steps (e.g., moving<br/>
  assumptions), so that script steps mostly match logical steps.<br/>
- It provides tactics and tatical to support structured layout,<br/>
  including reordering subgoals and supporting &quot;without loss of<br/>
  generality&quot; arguments.<br/>
- It provides a powerful rewriting tactic that supports chained<br/>
  rules, automatic unfolding of definitions and conditional rewriting,<br/>
  as well as precise control over where and how much rewriting occurs.<br/>
- It can be used in combination with the classic Coq tactic language.</p>
<p>Some features of the library:<br/>
- Exploits advanced features of Coq such as coercions and canonical<br/>
  projections to build generic theories (e.g., for decidable equality).<br/>
- Uses rewrite rules and dependent predicate families to state<br/>
  lemmas that can be applied deeply and bidirectionally. This means<br/>
  fewer structural steps and a smaller library, respectively.<br/>
- Uses boolean functions to represent sets (i.e., comprehensions),<br/>
  rather than an ad hoc set algebra.</p>
<p>The Ssreflect 1.2 distribution is available at<br/>
   <a href="http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/projects/mathematical-components-2/" title="http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/projects/mathematical-components-2/">http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/projects/mathematical-components-2/</a><br/>
It is distributed under either one (your choice) of the CeCILL-B or CeCILL<br/>
version 2 licences (the French equivalent of the BSD and GNU GPL licenses,<br/>
respectively).</p>
<p>The tactic language is quite stable; we have been using it<br/>
internally for three years essentially without change. We will support<br/>
new releases of Coq in due course. We also plan to extend the core<br/>
library as our more advanced work on general and linear algebra<br/>
progresses.</p>
