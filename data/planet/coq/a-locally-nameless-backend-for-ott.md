<p>The <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/">Ott</a> tool, 
developed by  Peter Sewell and Francesco Zappa Nardelli,
has recently been extended to compile language definitions
to a Coq representation in locally-nameless style with cofinite 
quantification, as popularised in Engineering Formal Metatheory by
Aydemir, Chargu&eacute;raud, Pierce, Pollack and Weirich. It deals with the
single-binder case only.</p>
<p>Some examples (including STLC, Fsub, and the nu-calculus of Pitts and
Stark) and the documentation are available from the <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/projects/ln_ott/">ln-ott page</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/">project web-site</a>.</p>
<p>This is related to the recent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100716005113/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~baydemir/papers/lngen/">LNgen</a> tool of Brian Aydemir and Stephanie Weirich.</p>
