<p>
The Coq development team is proud to announce the immediate availability of
the <a href="https://github.com/coq/platform/releases/tag/2021.02.0">Coq Platform 2021.02.0</a>
</p>

<p>
The Coq platform is a distribution of the Coq proof assistant together
with a selection of Coq libraries. It provides a set of scripts to
compile and install OPAM, Coq, Coq libraries and Coq plugins on MacOS,
Windows and many Linux distributions in a reliable way with consistent
results.
</p>

<p>
This release is based on Coq 8.13.1 and provides binary installers
for Windows and Linux. We plan to release 2021.02.1 as soon as the
MacOS installer is ready. The following point releases, starting with
2021.02.2, will focus on including more Coq libraries (and no
breaking change).
</p>
