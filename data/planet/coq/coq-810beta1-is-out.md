<p>The <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/tag/V8.10+beta1">first
beta release of Coq 8.10</a> is available for testing.</p>

<p>Coq version 8.10 contains two major new features: support for a native
machine integer type and a new sort SProp, a definitionally proof irrelevant
universe. It is also the result of refinements and stabilization of previous
features, deprecations or removals of deprecated features, cleanups of the
internals of the system and API, and many documentation improvements. This
release includes many user-visible changes, including deprecations and new
features. A more detailed list of changes appears in the <a href="https://coq.github.io/doc/v8.10/refman/changes.html#version-8-10">reference
manual</a>.</p>

<p>Feedback and <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/issues">bug
reports</a> are extremely welcome.</p>
