<p>There are two main changes brought by Coq 8.11.</p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces Ltac2, a new tactic language for writing more robust larger scale
tactics, with built-in support for datatypes and the multi-goal tactic monad.</li>
<li>Primitive floats are integrated in terms and follow the binary64 format
of the IEEE 754 standard, as specified in the `Coq.Float.Floats` library.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Many other cleanups and improvements have been performed and are further described in
