        <p>Some times ago, I released <a href="http://drup.github.io/2016/08/12/tyre/">Tyre</a>, 
a library for Typed Regular Expressions
that allows matching, printing and routing. While many people expressed interest,
the syntax was (rightfully) considered too obtuse for practical usage.
Thanks to Petter A. &lsquo;<a href="https://github.com/paurkedal">paurkedal</a>&rsquo; Urkedal, this should now be fixed!</p>
