<p>It has been 3 months since I joined <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a> and it
has been good fun so far. Along with the members of the <a href="http://rise.cse.iitm.ac.in/">RISE
group</a>, we&rsquo;ve initiated a project to build secure
applications on top of secure extensions of the open-source
<a href="http://shakti.org.in/">Shakti</a> RISC-V processor ecosystem. Unsurprisingly, my
language of choice to build the applications is <a href="http://www.ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>.
Given the availability of rich ecosystem of libraries under the
<a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a> library operating system for building unikernels,
we hope to minimise the amount of unsafe C code that the hardware has to contend
with and protect exploits against. As a first step, we have managed to get OCaml
programs to run on directly on top of the Shakti processor running in simulation
under QEMU and Spike ISA simulators <em>without an intervening operating system</em>.</p>



<p>A custom bootloader performs the necessary hardware initialisation and
transfers control directly to the OCaml program. We have
<a href="https://gitlab.com/shaktiproject/tools/shakti-tee/ocaml-baremetal-riscv">open-sourced</a>
all of the tools necessary to build your own kernel. This handy
<a href="https://gitlab.com/shaktiproject/tools/shakti-tee/ocaml-baremetal-riscv/tree/master/docker">dockerfile</a>
documents the entire process. For the impatient, an image is available in the
dockerhub:</p>

<p>The immediate next step will be getting the code to run on a Shakti softcore on
an FPGA. In addition to targeting high-end FPGAs, we will also be targeting the
$100 <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-a7-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists/">Arty
A7</a>
hobbyist board and release all of the software under liberal open-source
licenses.</p>

<p>Further along, we will port mirage libraries to Shakti following similar to the
setup in <a href="https://github.com/well-typed-lightbulbs/">Well-typed lightbulbs</a> and
implementing hardware security enhancements in Shakti for preventing spatial and
temporal attacks while running unsafe C code (with the ability to dynamically
turn it off when running OCaml!), hardware-assisted compartments, etc. Lots of
exciting possibilities on the horizon!</p>
