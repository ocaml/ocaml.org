<p>At Jane Street we use a pattern/library called &ldquo;expect tests&rdquo; that
makes test-writing feel like a REPL session, or like exploratory
programming in a Jupyter notebook&mdash;with feedback cycles so fast and
joyful that it feels almost tactile. Having used them for some time now
this is the only way I&rsquo;d ever want to write tests.</p>
