<p>Jane Street is sponsoring this year&rsquo;s <a href="https://makemit.org">MakeMIT
hackathon</a>, and we wanted to create a prize for
the winners that would do justice to the maker spirit of the
competition. As makers ourselves &ndash; it&rsquo;s not unusual to find a
&ldquo;software&rdquo; engineer here who hacks on FPGAs or who has a CNC machine
at home &ndash; it felt natural to get our hands dirty.</p>
