<p>Like most places, Jane Street largely teaches developers through a kind of apprenticeship
model. A team matching process tries to thoughtfully match new devs to a team that suits
them; and from there carefully chosen projects, one-on-one mentorship, code review, and
close collaboration with people “on the row” – teammates sitting near you – does most of
the rest.</p>
