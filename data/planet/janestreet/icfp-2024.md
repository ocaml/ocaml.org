<p>It’s no secret that Jane Street is an active participant in the programming language
community, and we’re excited to be attending <a href="https://icfp24.sigplan.org/">ICFP 2024</a>, the
International Conference on Functional Programming, in Milan next week! Most members of
our OCaml Language team will be there, and as usual, we look forward to sharing our work
with the wider community. Please see below for a full list of papers and talks that Jane
Street folk are involved in.  Note that a lot of these are collaborations of one kind or
another with researchers outside of Jane Street.</p>
