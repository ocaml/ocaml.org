<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is an annual Advent calendar
featuring small programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl, which has been running
every December since 2015. Being the puzzle-lovers we are, a bunch of us at
Jane Street participate in Advent of Code every year.</p>
