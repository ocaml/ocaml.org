<p>Neural networks are often thought of as opaque, black-box function approximators, but theoretical tools let us describe and visualize their behavior. In particular, let&rsquo;s study piecewise-linearity, a property many neural networks share. This property has <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6098">been</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02114">studied</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08778">before</a>, but we&rsquo;ll try to visualize it in more detail than has been previously done.&nbsp;</p>
