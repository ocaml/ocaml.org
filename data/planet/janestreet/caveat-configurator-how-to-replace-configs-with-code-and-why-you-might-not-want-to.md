<p>We have a new <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/">tech talk</a> coming up on
May 17th, from our very own Dominick LoBraico. This one is about how to
represent configurations with programs. In some sense, this is an obvious idea.
Lots of programmers have experienced the dysphoria that comes from watching your
elegant little configuration format metamorphize into a badly constructed
programming language with miserable tools. This happens because, as you try to
make your configs clearer and more concise, you often end up walking down the
primrose path of making your config format ever more language-like. But you
never really have the time to make it into a proper language.</p>
