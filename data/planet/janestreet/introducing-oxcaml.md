<p>At Jane Street, we’ve been actively making improvements to OCaml for a long time. Over the
last few years, we’ve started to build some fairly ambitious extensions to the
language. Our aim is to make OCaml a <strong>great language for performance engineering</strong>. This
work has always been open source, and our hope is to <strong>contribute these extensions to
upstream OCaml</strong>, but we’re still iterating on their design as we gain experience using
them. As such, we think the time has come to make it easier for people to <strong>use our
extensions in the outside world</strong>. That starts with giving our branch of the compiler the
three most important components of a modern programming language: a cool name, a cute logo
and a snazzy website. So, without further ado, we are excited to announce <strong>OxCaml</strong>.</p>
