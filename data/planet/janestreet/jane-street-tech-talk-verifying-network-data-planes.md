<p>After a summer hiatus, the Jane Street Tech Talks series is back on
for the fall! Last we left it, our very own Dominick LoBraico
presented on the evolution of our internal configuration methodology
and the systems that support it. For anybody that missed it, you can
check out a recording of the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pX7-AG52BU">on YouTube</a>.</p>
