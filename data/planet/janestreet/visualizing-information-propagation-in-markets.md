<p>The Dojima rice market, established around 1716, is widely considered to
be the world&rsquo;s first organized futures exchange. Instead of directly
exchanging money for rice on the spot, merchants would agree on a price
and future date at which rice and money would be exchanged. This allowed
farmers and consumers to hedge their risk. As a result, information
about the abundance or lack of rice would travel across the country as
fast as rice merchants carried it.</p>
