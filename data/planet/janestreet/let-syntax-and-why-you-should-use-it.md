<p>Earlier this year, we created
a <a href="http://github.com/janestreet/ppx_let">ppx_let</a>, a PPX rewriter that
introduces a syntax for working with monadic and applicative libraries like
Command, Async, Result and Incremental. We&rsquo;ve now amassed about six months of
experience with it, and we&rsquo;ve now seen enough to recommend it to a wider
audience.</p>
