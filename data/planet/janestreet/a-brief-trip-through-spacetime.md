<p>Spacetime is a new memory profiling facility for OCaml to help find space leaks
and unwanted allocations. Whilst still a little rough around the edges, we&rsquo;ve
found it to be a very useful tool. Since there&rsquo;s not much documentation for
using spacetime beyond <a href="https://github.com/lpw25/prof_spacetime/blob/master/Readme.md">this
readme</a>, I&rsquo;ve
written a little intro to give people an idea of how to use it.</p>
