<p>Our traders and researchers love Python for its agility and for its huge
open-source ecosystem, especially when it comes to machine learning. But
the heavy use of notebooks can make it difficult to support. Notebooks
have a very different lifecycle than regular code, and aren&rsquo;t always
rigorously version controlled. And while most of our code (much of it
written in OCaml) lives in a monorepo, putting all notebooks there is
difficult; many notebooks end up being stored all over the place.</p>
