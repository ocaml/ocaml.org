<p>We&rsquo;re busy preparing for our software engineering <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/unraveling/">fall hiring
season</a>. Over the years we&rsquo;ve
done our best to make our interview process more transparent to
candidates. While many candidates show up knowing something about what
our interviews look like, much of the information floating around on
the internet is outdated or wrong. These past few months have also
changed a lot about the process as we&rsquo;ve adapted to working from home
and other effects of COVID-19.</p>
