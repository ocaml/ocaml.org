<p>It is November 19 today, and I’m one month and 4 days late for the October
Retrospective! Truth is, <code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-variable">$WORK</span></code> has been intense lately, to a point
where I have not made much progress on my side projects. Anyway.</p>
<p>I have implemented the last feature I was really missing in my daily
use of Spatial Sway: moving windows to adjacent workspaces. As a
result, I think I can say that Spatial Sway has really reached the
“Minimum Viable Product” stage, with a convenient UX, and a nice
enough UI. It is still lacking when it comes to configurability,
though. It is the next item of my TODO list, but I have no idea when I
will implement the support for a configuration file.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the past two months was the
<a href="https://nanowrimo.org" marked="">NaNoWriMo&nbsp;<span class="icon"><svg><use href="/~lthms/img/icons.svg#external-link"></use></svg></span></a>. I took the last week of October and the
first week of November off to plan and start writing a fiction project for it.
Writing again was really nice, and I even gave writing fiction in English a
shot. That made me uncover a bug in the English support of
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/ogam" marked="">ogam&nbsp;<span class="icon"><svg><use href="/~lthms/img/icons.svg#external-link"></use></svg></span></a>, my markup language for fiction writers,
which led me to publish a fix on Crates.io. However, as soon as I came back to
<code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-variable">$WORK</span></code>, my writing spree ended. That’s okay, though. It gave me plenty
of ideas for future sessions. Thanks, NaNoWriMo! Sorry to quit so soon, and see
you next year, maybe.</p>
<p>Finally, a nice surprise of the past month is that <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/6489" marked="">someone has started working
on adding proper support for <code class="hljs">coqffi</code> to
<code class="hljs">dune</code>&nbsp;<span class="icon"><svg><use href="/~lthms/img/icons.svg#github"></use></svg></span></a>, the build system for OCaml
and Coq! I’m thrilled by this. Thanks,
<a href="https://github.com/Alizter" marked=""><strong>@Alizter</strong>&nbsp;<span class="icon"><svg><use href="/~lthms/img/icons.svg#github"></use></svg></span></a>!</p>
<p>This wraps up this retrospective. I hope I will have more interesting,
concrete news to share next month.</p>
