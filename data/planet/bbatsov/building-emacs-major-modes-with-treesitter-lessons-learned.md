title: 'Building Emacs Major Modes with TreeSitter: Lessons Learned'
description: "Over the past year I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time building TreeSitter-powered
  major modes for Emacs \u2013 clojure-ts-mode (as co-maintainer), neocaml (from scratch),
  and asciidoc-mode (also from scratch). Between the three projects I\u2019ve accumulated
  enough battle scars to write about the experience. This post distills the key lessons
  for anyone thinking about writing a TreeSitter-based major mode, or curious about
  what it\u2019s actually like."
