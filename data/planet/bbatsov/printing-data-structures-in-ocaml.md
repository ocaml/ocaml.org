title: Printing Data Structures in OCaml
description: One of the first things developers want to do in any language is print
  out the value of a variable. In languages with dynamic typing or extensive reflection,
  this is often a trivial, built-in operation. In OCaml, the story is a bit different.
  Its strong, static type system requires you to be explicit about how to turn a data
  structure into a string representation. There is no universal print or console.log
  that works on any type.
