title: 'Setting up Emacs for OCaml Development: Neocaml Edition'
description: "A few years ago I wrote about setting up Emacs for OCaml development.
  Back then the recommended stack was tuareg-mode + merlin-mode, with Merlin providing
  the bulk of the IDE experience. A lot has changed since then \u2013 the OCaml tooling
  has evolved considerably, and I\u2019ve been working on some new tools myself. Time
  for an update."
