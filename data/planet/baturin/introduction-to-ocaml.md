    This post series started as a response to requests from some friends curious about OCaml.
There are quite a few nice books already, but I realized that if I just recommend them any one of those
books, it still will leave me with quite a few things to explain in depth, or force me to recommend another
just to learn about that part. So I thought I may as well write something that hopefully will allow
a person who already knows how to program in some other language get started with writing OCaml programs
and continue learning on their own and find their own sources.
