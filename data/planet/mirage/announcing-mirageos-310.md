        <p>IPv6 and dual (IPv4 and IPv6) stack support https://github.com/mirage/mirage/pull/1187 https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1190</p>
<p>Since a long time, IPv6 code was around in our TCP/IP stack (thanks to @nojb who developed it in 2014). Some months ago, @hannesm and @MagnusS got excited to use it. After we managed to fix some bugs and add some test cases, and writing more code to setup IPv6-only and dual stacks, we are eager to share this support for MirageOS in a released version. We expect there to be bugs lingering around, but duplicate address detection (neighbour solicitation and advertisements) has been implemented, and (unless &quot;--accept-router-advertisement=false&quot;) router advertisements are decoded and used to configure the IPv6 part of the stack. Configuring a static IPv6 address is also possible (with
&quot;--ipv6=2001::42/64&quot;).</p>
<p>While at it, we unified the boot arguments between the different targets: namely, on Unix (when using the socket stack), you can now pass &quot;--ipv4=127.0.0.1/24&quot; to the same effect as the direct stack: only listen on 127.0.0.1 (the subnet mask is ignored for the Unix socket stack).</p>
<p>A dual stack unikernel has &quot;--ipv4-only=BOOL&quot; and &quot;--ipv6-only=BOOL&quot; parameters, so a unikernel binary could support both Internet Protocol versions, while the operator can decide which protocol version to use. I.e. now there are both development-time (stackv4 vs stackv6 vs stackv4v6) choices, as well as the run-time choice (via boot parameter).</p>
<p>I'm keen to remove the stackv4 &amp; stackv6 in future versions, and always develop with dual stack (leaving it to configuration &amp; startup time to decide whether to enable ipv4 and ipv6).</p>
<p>Please also note that the default IPv4 network configuration no longer uses 10.0.0.1 as default gateway (since there was no way to unset the default gateway https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1147).</p>
<p>For unikernel developers, there are some API changes in the Mirage module</p>
<ul>
<li>New &quot;v4v6&quot; types for IP protocols and stacks
</li>
<li>The ipv6_config record was adjusted in the same fashion as the ipv4_config type: it is now a record of a network (V6.Prefix.t) and gateway (V6.t option)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some parts of the Mirage_key module were unified as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arp.ip_address is available (for a dual Ipaddr.t)
</li>
<li>Arg.ipv6_address replaces Arg.ipv6 (for an Ipaddr.V6.t)
</li>
<li>Arg.ipv6 replaces Arg.ipv6_prefix (for a Ipaddr.V6.Prefix.t)
</li>
<li>V6.network and V6.gateway are available, mirroring the V4 submodule
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're ready to experiment with the dual stack: below is a diff for our basic network example (from mirage-skeleton/device-usage/network) replacing IPv4 with a dual stack, and the tlstunnel unikernel commit
https://github.com/roburio/tlstunnel/commit/2cb3e5aa11fca4b48bb524f3c0dbb754a6c8739b
changed tlstunnel from IPv4 stack to dual stack.</p>
