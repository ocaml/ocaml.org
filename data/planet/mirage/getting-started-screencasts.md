        <p>We put together some quick screencasts to make it easier for people to get
started with MirageOS. They're all in a playlist below, which is around 10
minutes in total.</p>
<p>There are currently 4 videos which walk through some of the typical steps.
The first three cover installation, building a 'hello world', and building a
Xen unikernel on an Ubuntu machine. The fourth video gives an overview of the
development workflows that are possible with OPAM and Git.</p>
<p>These should give everyone a clear idea of what it's like to work with the
tools before leaping in and installing things!</p>
<p>If anyone would like to help us make more of these screencasts, please do get
in touch on the <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel">mailing list</a> &mdash; I've also listed it as one of our many
