        <p>We're excited to announce MirageOS 3.0! MirageOS is a modern, modular library operating system that allows the creation of small, secure, legacy-free services. MirageOS applications can be compiled to run as self-contained virtual machines (a few MB in size) on Xen or KVM hosts, FreeBSD's bhyve, or even as regular Unix processes (allowing access to regular debugging tools).  The system libraries themselves can be reused in traditional applications, just like any other software library.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/releases/tag/v3.0.0">Full release notes are available on GitHub</a>.  If you're interested in getting started with MirageOS 3 right away, you might be interested in the <a href="https://mirage.io/docs/hello-world">revamped guide to getting started</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton">a small collection of example unikernels</a>, or the <a href="https://mirage.io/docs/mirage2-to-mirage3">porting guide for updating Mirage 2.x unikernels to Mirage 3</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the things in MirageOS 3 that we're most excited about:</p>
<h3>Solo5</h3>
<p>MirageOS 3.0 is the first release that integrates the solo5 targets, <code>virtio</code> and <code>ukvm</code>, fully with the <code>mirage</code> front-end tool.  Now you can <code>mirage configure -t ukvm</code>, build a unikernel, and run directly with the generated <code>ukvm-bin</code>!  We've updated the &quot;hello world&quot; tutorial to reflect our excitement about <code>ukvm</code> -- the <code>ukvm</code> target is considerably easier to interface with and configure than <code>xen</code> was, and for a lot of users this will be a clearer path toward operational deployment of unikernels.</p>
<p>For a lot more information on the Solo5 targets, see <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/introducing-solo5">the earlier blog post announcing solo5</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud16/workshop-program/presentation/williams">Unikernel Monitors: Extending Minimalism Outside of the Box</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/solo5/solo5/tree/master/README.md">the very readable solo5 repository README</a>.  You can also read how to <a href="https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/Solo5">run solo5 unikernels on FreeBSD via bhyve</a>.</p>
<h3>Playing More Nicely with OPAM</h3>
<p>MirageOS 3 has a much richer interface for dealing with the package manager and external library dependencies.  A user can now specify a version or range of versions for a package dependency, and the <code>mirage</code> front-end tool will construct a custom <code>opam</code> file including both those package dependencies and the ones automatically generated from <code>mirage configure</code>.  <code>mirage</code> will also consider version constraints for its own packages -- from now on, <code>opam</code> should notice that releases of <code>mirage</code> are incompatible with your unikernel.</p>
<p>For more information on dealing with packages and dependencies, the documentation for <a href="http://docs.mirage.io/functoria/Functoria/index.html#pkg">the Functoria.package function</a> will likely be of use.  <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/blob/mirage-dev/device-usage/prng/config.ml">The PRNG device-usage example in mirage-skeleton</a> demonstrates some useful invocations of <code>package</code>.</p>
<h3>Amazing Docs</h3>
<p>Thanks to a lot of hard work, a fully interlinked set of module documentation is now automatically generated by <code>odig</code> and available for your reading pleasure at <a href="http://docs.mirage.io">the MirageOS central documentation repository</a>.  While documentation was previously available for most modules, it was scattershot and often required having several disconnected pages open simultaneously.  We hope you'll find the new organization more convenient.  The documentation generation system is still in beta, so please report <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-doc/odoc/issues">issues upstream</a> if you run across rendering issues or have other feedback.</p>
<h3>Result-y Errors</h3>
<p>The module types provided by MirageOS 3 replace the previous error paradigm (a combination of exceptions and directly returning polymorphic variants) with one that uses <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/147">the Result module included in OCaml 4.03 and up</a>.  A notable exception is when problems occur during the unikernel's initialization (i.e., in <code>connect</code> functions), where unikernels will now fail hard as soon as they can.  The goal of these changes is to surface errors when the application cares about them, and to not present any uninitialized or unstable state to an application at start time.</p>
<p>The MirageOS 3 module types define a core set of likely errors for each module type (see <a href="http://docs.mirage.io/mirage-flow/Mirage_flow/module-type-S/index.html">the mirage-flow module type</a> for an example), which can be extended by any given implementation.  Module types now specify that each implementation must include a pretty-printer that can handle all emitted error types.  Functions that return a <code>success</code> type when they run as expected return a <code>(success, error) Result.t</code>, which the caller can print with <code>pp_error</code> if the value is an <code>Error</code>.</p>
<p>For more background on the result type, see the <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/rresult">Rresult library</a> which defines further useful operations on <code>Result.t</code> and is used widely in MirageOS libraries.  <a href="https://mirage.io/docs/mirage-3.0-errors">A more in-depth explanation of errors</a> in Mirage 3 is also available.</p>
<h3>Logs Where You Want Them</h3>
<p>MirageOS version 2.9.0 included automatic support for logging via the <code>Logs</code> and <code>Mirage_logs</code> library, but by default logs were always printed to the console and changing the log reporter was cumbersome.  In MirageOS 3, you can send logs to a consumer of syslog messages with <code>syslog_udp</code>, <code>syslog_tcp</code>, or with the full authentication and encryption provided by <code>ocaml-tls</code> using <code>syslog_tls</code>.  For more information, see <a href="https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/Syslog">the excellent writeup at hannes.nqsb.io</a>.</p>
<h3>Disaggregated Module Type Definitions</h3>
<p>Breaking all of the MirageOS 3.0 APIs showed us that keeping them all in the same place made updates really difficult.  There's now an additional set of packages which contain the definitions for each set of module types (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-fs">mirage-fs</a> for the <code>FS</code> module type, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block">mirage-block</a> for the <code>BLOCK</code> module type, etc).  A few module types had some additional useful code that was nicely functorized over the module type in question, so we've bundled that code in the module type packages as well.  Documentation for all of the module type packages is available at <a href="http://docs.mirage.io">the Mirage documentation hub</a>.</p>
<p>We hope that this change combined with the <code>opam</code> workflow changes above will result in <em>much</em> less painful API changes in the future, as it will be possible for unikernel authors to target specific versions more readily.</p>
<h3>Clockier Clocks, Timelier Time</h3>
<p>In older MirageOS versions, we noticed that we were often having to deduce a span of time from having taken two wall-clock samples of the current time.  In MirageOS 3, you have your choice of two types of clock - <code>MCLOCK</code>, which provides a monotonically increasing clock reflecting the time elapsed since the clock started, and <code>PCLOCK</code>, which provides a traditional POSIX wall-clock time.  Most previous users of <code>CLOCK</code> were able to migrate to the more-honest, less-complicated <code>MCLOCK</code>.  For an example of both clocks, see <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/blob/mirage-dev/device-usage/clock/unikernel.ml">the speaking clock</a>.  You may also be interested in <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/pull/232/files">an example of converting existing code from <code>CLOCK</code> to <code>MCLOCK</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>MCLOCK</code> provides a nice interface for dealing with time at a nanosecond granularity.  The <code>TIME</code> module type has been updated to expect an <code>int64</code> number of nanoseconds, rather than a float, as an argument to its function <code>sleep</code>.  For those of us who don't think in nanoseconds, the <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/duration">Duration</a> library provides convenient functions for translating from and to more familiar units like seconds.</p>
<h3>Build System Shift</h3>
<p>Mirage 3.0 has many, many more packages than before, and so we turned to <a href="http://ocamllabs.io">OCaml Labs</a> to help us to <a href="http://ocamllabs.io/projects/2017/02/23/topkg.html">scale up our package management</a>. In many but not all MirageOS packages, we've replaced <code>oasis</code> with <code>topkg</code>, the &quot;transitory OCaml software packager&quot;. <code>topkg</code> is a lighter layer over the underlying <code>ocamlbuild</code>.  Using <code>topkg</code> has allowed us to remove several thousand lines of autogenerated code across the MirageOS package universe, and let our release manager automate a significant amount of the MirageOS 3 release process.  We hope to continue benefitting from the ease of using <code>topkg</code> and <code>topkg-care</code>.</p>
<p>Not all packages are using <code>topkg</code> yet -- if you see one that isn't, feel free to submit a pull request!</p>
<h3>Less Code, Better Behavior</h3>
<p>There's more in MirageOS 3 than we can fit in one blog post without our eyes glazing over.  The release notes for <code>mirage</code> version 3.0.0 are a nice summary, but you might also be interested in the full accounting of changes for every package released as a part of the MirageOS 3 effort; links for each library are available at the end of this post.</p>
<p>Across the package universe, a net several thousand lines of code were <em>removed</em> as part of MirageOS 3.  Many were autogenerated build-time support files removed in the transition from <code>oasis</code> to <code>topkg</code>.  Others were small support modules like <code>Result</code>, which had previously been replicated in many places and were replaced by a reference to a common implementation.  Some large implementations (like the DHCP client code in <code>mirage-tcpip</code>) were replaced by smaller, better implementations in common libraries (like <code>charrua-core</code>).</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-fat/compare/0.11.0...0.12.0">ocaml-fat</a> had 1,280 additions and 10,265 deletions for a net of -8,985 lines of code; version 0.12.0 jettisoned a custom in-memory block device in favor of using the in-memory block device provided by <code>Mirage_block_lwt.Mem</code>, removed several thousand lines of autogenerated OASIS code, removed several custom error-case polymorphic variants, and lost a custom <code>result</code> module.  The <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/compare/v2.9.1...v3.0.0">mirage repository itself</a> netted -8,490 lines of code while adding all of the features above!</p>
<p>A number of improvements were made to <code>mirage</code> to limit the number of unnecessary build artifacts and reduce the amount of unnecessary code linked into unikernels.  Modules you're unlikely to use like <code>Str</code> are no longer included in the OCaml runtime.  MirageOS 3 is also the first to drop support for OCaml 4.02.3, meaning that all supported compilers support the <code>flambda</code> compiler extension and a number of related optimization opportunities.</p>
<p>Very many people were involved in making the MirageOS package universe smaller and better than it was before.
