        <p>A few months ago, partly as a stunt, mostly because we could, Anil and I put together <a href="http://decks.openmirage.org/oscon13/">a presentation</a> for <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/">OSCON'13</a> about Mirage in Mirage. That is, as a self-hosting Mirage web application that served up slides using <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">RevealJS</a>. It was a bit of a hack, but it was cool (we thought!) and it worked. Several more presentations were written and given this way, at venues ranging from the [XenSummit 2013][xensummit] to [ACM FOCI 2013][foci] to the Cambridge Computer Lab's [MSc in Advanced Computer Science][acs].</p>

[acs]: http://decks.openmirage.org/cam13/</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage10">release of Mirage 1.0</a>, <a href="http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp">CoHTTP</a>, <a href="http://github.com/mirage/cowabloga">Cowabloga</a> and
the new <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a> based <a href="https://mirage.io/">website</a>, it was time to refresh them
and as a little seasonal gift, give them a shiny new index with some actual CSS
styling. So <a href="http://decks.openmirage.org/">here they are</a>, a set of presentations that have been given
by various members of the Mirage team over the last 6 months or so. They cover
a range of topics, from general introductions to the Xen roadmap to more
detailed technical background. And, of course, as Mirage is under constant
rapid development, some of the older content may already be outdated. But <a href="http://github.com/mirage/mirage-decks">the
code for the site itself</a> serves as another example of a simple --
somewhat simpler than the <a href="https://mirage.io/">Mirage website</a> in fact -- Mirage web
application.</p>
