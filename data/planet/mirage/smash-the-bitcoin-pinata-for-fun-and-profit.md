<p>Last summer we announced the beta release of a clean-slate implementation of
TLS in pure OCaml, alongside a <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/introducing-ocaml-tls">series of blog posts</a> that described
the libraries and the thinking behind them.  It took two hackers six months
&mdash; starting on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GpcQs">the beach</a> &mdash;  to get the stack to that point and
their <a href="https://tls.nqsb.io">demo server</a> is still going strong. Since then, the team has
continued working and recently <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6443_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412271245_-_trustworthy_secure_modular_operating_system_engineering_-_hannes_-_david_kaloper.html#video">presented</a> at the 31st Chaos
Communication Congress.</p>
<p>The authors are putting their stack to the test again and this time they've
built a <strong><a href="http://ownme.ipredator.se">Bitcoin Pi&ntilde;ata</a></strong>! Essentially, they've hidden a
private key to a bitcoin address within a Unikernel running on Xen. If you're
able to smash your way in, then you get to keep the spoils.</p>
<p>There's more context around this in my <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/bitcoin-pinata">Pi&ntilde;ata post</a> and you can see
the details on the <a href="http://ownme.ipredator.se">site itself</a>. Remember that the codebase is
<a href="https://github.com/mirleft/">all open</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/issues?q=label:%22security%20concern%22%20">issues</a>) so there's nothing to
reverse engineer. Have fun!</p>
