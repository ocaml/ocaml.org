        <p>We are pleased to announce <a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin/releases">Irmin
2.0.0</a>, a major release of the
Git-like distributed branching and storage substrate that underpins MirageOS.
We began the release process for all the components that make up Irmin <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2019-05-13-on-the-road-to-irmin-v2">back in
May 2019</a>, and
there have been close to 1000 commits since Irmin 1.4.0 release back in June
2018. To celebrate this milestone, we have a new logo and opened a dedicated
website: <a href="https://irmin.org">irmin.org</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more details about the new features in the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2019-11-21-irmin-v2">Irmin v2 blog
post</a>.  Enjoy the new release,
and stay tuned for the upcoming Wodan integration in 2020 that will be a stable
filesystem for the hypervisor targets for MirageOS that do not have a
conventional OS kernel underneath them!</p>
