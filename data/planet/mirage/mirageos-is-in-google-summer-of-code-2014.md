        <p>MirageOS will part of the <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014">Google Summer of Code</a> 2014
program, thanks to the Xen Project's participation!  It's been a few years
since I've mentored for GSoc, but I still have fond memories of some great
projects in the past (such as the legendary <a href="http://vmgl.sourceforge.net/">Quake testing</a>
we were forced to do for hours on end).  I've already received a number of
queries about this year's program from potential students, so here's a few
things to note to become a successful applicant.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students still need to apply and be accepted. Your chances of being
selected are much higher if you demonstrate some participation and
code contributions (even minor) <em>before</em> submitting an application.
Thus, even if you don't have a copy of Xen around, roll up your sleeves
and head over to the <a href="https://mirage.io/docs/install">installation instructions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributions do not have to be just code.  They can be documentation,
help with packaging, wiki posts about a particular use, or test cases
to improve code coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's unlikely that we'll get students who are very familiar with both
OCaml and Xen (if you are, definitely get in touch with us!).  You should
therefore look over the <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/GSoc_2014#Mirage_OS">project ideas</a>
as a set of guidelines and not firm suggestions.  If you have a particular
thing you'd like to do with Mirage (for example, work on the JavaScript
backend, an <a href="https://github.com/andrewray/iocamljs">IPython interface</a> or
a particular protocol implementation such as XMPP, then that's fine.  Just
get in touch with us on the <a href="https://mirage.io/community">mailing lists</a> or directly via
e-mail, and we can work through them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under some circumstances, we can provide resources such as a login to
a Xen machine, or delegated credits on a cloud provider.  Don't let that
stop you from applying for a project idea.  In general though, it's best
to only depend on your own computer resources if practical to do so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
