      _Tetra Master_ is the optional card game in **Final Fantasy IX**. At first glance, it seems similar to _Triple Triad_ — the card game from Final Fantasy VIII. And while you can develop a general intuition for how to win, especially if you have strong cards, after playing over a hundred matches, I had to admit something: just playing the game and reading all the _in-game_ tutorials wasn’t enough to truly understand the rules. Eventually, I gave in and started looking things up to figure out what I was missing. The complete absence of **any actual rules** — whether in the game or the manual — left me utterly frustrated, which is what led me to write this article, illustrated in OCaml.
