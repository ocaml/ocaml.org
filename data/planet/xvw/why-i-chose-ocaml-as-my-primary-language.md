      I started using the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) language regularly around 2012, and since then, my interest and enthusiasm for this language have only grown. It has become my preferred choice for almost all my personal projects, and it has also influenced my professional choices.
Since 2014, I have been actively participating in public conferences dedicated to programming and software development, where I often express my enthusiasm for OCaml in ways that may be a bit over the top (but always passionate). This has earned me, in a friendly way, the nickname _OCaml evangelist_ — a title that, I admit, I find very flattering.
Moreover, I’m not alone in thinking this. Despite the common misconception that OCaml wouldn’t be a pragmatic choice for industry, major companies such as [Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/?s=ocaml), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/slam/?from=https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/&amp;type=exact), [Ahref](https://tech.ahrefs.com/tagged/ocaml), [Tarides](https://tarides.com), [OCamlPro](https://ocamlpro.com/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company?s=ocaml), [Docker](https://github.com/moby/vpnkit), [Janestreet](https://www.janestreet.com/technology/), [Citrix](https://xapi-project.github.io/), [Tezos](https://tezos.com), and [many others](https://ocaml.org/industrial-users) actively use it.
