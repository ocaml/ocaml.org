<p>There is a new draft on my <a href="http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~puech/">web page</a>, that should be of interest to those who enjoyed my posts about <a href="https://syntaxexclamation.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/reversing-data-structures/" title="Reversing data&nbsp;structures">reversing data structures</a> and the <a href="https://syntaxexclamation.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/reverse-natural-deduction-and-get-sequent-calculus/" title="Reverse natural deduction and get sequent&nbsp;calculus">relation between natural deduction and sequent calculus</a>. It is an article submitted to <a href="http://aplas2013.soic.indiana.edu/">APLAS 2013</a>, and it is called&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~puech/upside.pdf" title="Proofs, upside down">Proofs, upside down.</a></em> In a nutshell, I am arguing for the use of functional PL tools, in particular classic functional program transformations, to understand and explain proof theory phenomena. Here, I show that there is the same relationship between natural deduction and (a restriction of) the sequent calculus than between this recursive function:</p>
<pre class="brush: fsharp; title: ; notranslate">
let rec tower_rec = function
  | [] -&gt; 1
  | x :: xs -&gt; x &lowast;&lowast; tower_rec xs

let tower xs = tower_rec xs
</pre>
<p>written in &ldquo;direct style&rdquo;, and that equivalent, iterative version:</p>
<pre class="brush: fsharp; title: ; notranslate">
let rec tower_acc acc = function
  | [] -&gt; acc
  | x :: xs -&gt; tower_acc (x &lowast;&lowast; acc) xs

let tower xs = tower_acc 1 (List.rev xs)
</pre>
<p>written in &ldquo;accumulator-passing style&rdquo;. And that relationship is the composition of CPS-transformation, defunctionalization and reforestation, the well-known transformations we all came to know and love!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it. Of course, any comment will be <i>much</i> appreciated, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to drop a line below!</p>

<strong>Proofs, upside down</strong><br/>
<strong>A functional correspondence between&nbsp;natural deduction and the sequent calculus</strong><br/>
It is well-known in proof theory that sequent calculus proofs&nbsp;differ from natural deduction proofs by &ldquo;reversing&rdquo; elimination rules&nbsp;upside down into left introduction rules. It is also well-known that to&nbsp;each recursive, functional program corresponds an equivalent iterative,&nbsp;accumulator-passing program, where the accumulator stores the continuation of the iteration, in &ldquo;reversed&rdquo; order. Here, we compose these remarks and show that a restriction of the intuitionistic sequent calculus,&nbsp;LJT, is exactly an accumulator-passing version of intuitionistic natural&nbsp;deduction NJ. More precisely, we obtain this correspondence by applying&nbsp;a series of off-the-shelf program transformations &agrave; la Danvy et al. on&nbsp;a type checker for the bidirectional &lambda;-calculus, and get a type checker&nbsp;for the &lambda;-calculus, the proof term assignment of LJT. This functional&nbsp;correspondence revisits the relationship between natural deduction and&nbsp;the sequent calculus by systematically deriving the rules of the latter&nbsp;from the former, and allows to derive new sequent calculus rules from&nbsp;the introduction and elimination rules of new logical connectives.
