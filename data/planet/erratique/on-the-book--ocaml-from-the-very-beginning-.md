<p>Cambridge overflows with OCaml programmers. I got to meet John Whitington of <a href="http://www.coherentpdf.com/ocaml-libraries.html">camlpdf</a> fame. He kindly offered me a copy of his book &laquo;&nbsp;<a href="http://ocaml-book.com">OCaml from the very beginning</a>. &raquo; I read it and made a small review <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R28WYJ13WA94YL/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0957671105&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=">here</a>.</p>
