<p><a href="http://ocamllabs.io">OCaml Labs</a> kindly invited me to spend a second summer in Cambridge for working on OCaml free software graphical libraries. I'm looking forward to reconnect with the regular lab members and meet the other <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/welcome-to-our-summer-hackers">interesting guests</a>.</p>
