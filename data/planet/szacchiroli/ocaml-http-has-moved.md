<h1>OCaml HTTP is now on the OCaml forge</h1>
<p>It's been a <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2009/03/ocaml-http_is_looking_for_a_new_maintainer/">
long time</a>. But finally OCaml HTTP has a <a href="http://ocaml-http.forge.ocamlcore.org/">new home</a> and a new
maintainer.</p>
<p>Please welcome me in thanking <a href="http://arlen.co/">Arlen
Cuss</a> who has kindly agreed to become the new maintainer.</p>
