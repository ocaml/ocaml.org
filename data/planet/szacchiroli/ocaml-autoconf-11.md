<h1>new OCaml Autoconf release: 1.1</h1>
<p>We have just released <a href="http://forge.ocamlcore.org/frs/download.php/282/ocaml-autoconf-1.1.tar.gz">
version 1.1</a> of <a href="http://ocaml-autoconf.forge.ocamlcore.org/">OCaml Autoconf</a>: a
set of M4 macros for integrating your OCaml project with autoconf.
It is mostly a regular maintenance release with some bug fixes,
some new features, and most notably a new mini-tutorial and example
by Richard Jones (including how to deal with automake).</p>
