A R mode is now available for Chamo, as a <a href="http://home.gna.org/cameleon/snippets.en.html">separate snippet</a>. By now, this mode has only one key binding, to call the &quot;r_eval&quot; command. This command sends the contents of the active view to a background R process. The output of this process is displayed in the &quot;outputs&quot; window. Other commands can easily be defined the same way to interact with other programs (see <a href="http://home.gna.org/cameleon/snippets/code_R_mode.html">the details</a>).<br/><br/>If some text is selected in the view, then only this text is sent to the R process. Closing the R output tab in the &quot;outputs&quot; window closes the R process. When the &quot;r_eval&quot; command is executed again, a new process is created. If the command is executed and the R process is still running, then it is used and no other process is launched.<br/><br/><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RT8DPiBmxGY/SCBvaxuVAVI/AAAAAAAAAAo/LOXoepGGYx8/s1600-h/r_mode.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RT8DPiBmxGY/SCBvaxuVAVI/AAAAAAAAAAo/LOXoepGGYx8/s320/r_mode.png" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" alt="" border="0"/></a>
