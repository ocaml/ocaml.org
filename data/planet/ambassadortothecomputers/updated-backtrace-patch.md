<p>I&rsquo;ve updated my <a href="http://skydeck.com/blog/programming/stack-traces-in-ocaml">backtrace</a> <a href="http://skydeck.com/blog/programming/more-stack-traces-in-ocaml">patch</a> to work with OCaml 3.11.x as well as 3.10.x. The patch provides</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>access to backtraces from within a program (this is already provided in stock 3.11.x)</p> 
</li> 
 
<li> 
<p>backtraces for dynamically-loaded bytecode</p> 
</li> 
 
<li> 
<p>backtraces in the (bytecode) toplevel</p> 
</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>In addition there are a few improvements since the last version:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>debugging events are allocated outside the heap, so memory use should be better with forking (on Linux at least, the data is shared on copy-on-write pages but the first GC causes the pages be copied)</p> 
</li> 
 
<li> 
<p>fixed a bug that could cause spurious &ldquo;unknown location&rdquo; lines in the backtrace</p> 
</li> 
 
<li> 
<p>a script to apply the patch (instead of the previous multi-step manual process)</p> 
</li> 
</ul>
