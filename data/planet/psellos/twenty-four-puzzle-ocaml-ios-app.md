<div class="date">February 18, 2016</div>

<p>I wrote the Slide24 app a few years ago as a semi-credible example of an
iOS app coded in OCaml. It implements the 24 puzzle, a 5 &times; 5 grid of
sliding numbered tiles. I enjoyed the physical version of the puzzle
tremendously as a kid.</p>

<p>I just now updated Slide24 to build under Xcode 7.2, and tested that it
works under iOS 9.2 on every iPhone and iPad device (simulating the ones
I can&rsquo;t find in real life).</p>

</div>

<p>Slide24 has a <em>Solve</em> button that solves the puzzle for you if you don&rsquo;t
have the inclination to do it yourself. While I was updating the rest of
the code, I rewrote the heuristic search to generate solutions that are
more interesting to watch as a spectator. The essence of the improvement
is that the search now gets a pretty good (not optimal) solution, but is
able to solve the whole puzzle at once. I&rsquo;m thankful to Dr. Wheeler Ruml
of the University of New Hampshire for suggestions along these lines.</p>

<p>The new search doesn&rsquo;t quite reach the level of unbelievable perfection
that I was seeking, but it does produce solutions that don&rsquo;t look
anything like what a person would do. When I solve the puzzle I tend to
work on one area at a time, while the heuristic solution makes small
changes all over the place. Then things come together surprisingly
quickly at the end, which is just what I was hoping to see.</p>
