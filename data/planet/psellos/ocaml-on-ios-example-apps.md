<p>Through the decades I&rsquo;ve slowly realized that my heroes in the music are
the bass players. It&rsquo;s not too late for me to take up some kind of bass
instrument, but in the meantime the equivalent in the programming
universe is to help provide languages and systems for others to code on
top of. Isn&rsquo;t that so?</p>

<div class="flowaroundimg" style="margin-top: 0.4em;">
<a href="http://psellos.com/ocaml/example-app-portland.html"><img src="http://psellos.com/images/portland-upside-150.png" alt="image of Portland app"/></a>
<a href="http://psellos.com/ocaml/example-app-gamut.html"><img src="http://psellos.com/images/gamut2-sky-blue-150.png" alt="image of Gamut app"/></a>
</div>

<p>So, I guess that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing for OCaml on iOS. Most recently I&rsquo;ve
updated the two example apps Portland and Gamut. They&rsquo;re packaged up to
run on iOS devices and in the iOS Simulator, respectively, but of course
either can run on either.</p>

<p>If you just want to download them and start them up in Xcode, you can
get the sources here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://psellos.com/pub/portland/portland-3.0.2.tgz">Portland 3.0.2, tested on iOS 9.2</a>  </p>
  
  <p><a href="http://psellos.com/pub/gamut/gamut-3.0.2.tgz">Gamut 3.0.2, tested on iOS 9.2</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<div style="clear: both"></div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also written out some instructions and principles of operation
here:</p>
