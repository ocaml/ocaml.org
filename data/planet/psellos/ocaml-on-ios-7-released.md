<p>Pansophical reader, with your bafflingly good mobile OCaml project, I&rsquo;m ready at last to release an OCaml compiler for iOS 7. It works for all my projects, and I hope it works for yours.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a cross-compiling version of OCaml 4.01.0, and I&rsquo;m running it under Xcode 5.1.1 on OS X 10.9.4. You can download a binary installer here:</p>

<p>You can get sources from the Subversion repository here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you just want to see the differences from the base OCaml 4.01.0 release, the diffs are available here:</p>

<p>A simple test of the installed compiler is given on <a href="http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iphone.html">Compile OCaml for iOS</a>. There are also instructions for building from source.</p>

<p>Seriously, thanks to the many rather awesome people who have written asking about the status of the compiler. If your experience of mobile OCaml is like mine, we should all be able to make some surprising things.</p>

<p>There are always new revisions of everything coming out, so this is just one point of a long journey. I&rsquo;ve already had inquiries about the companion compiler OCamlXSim, which compiles for the iPhone Simulator. I&rsquo;ve also promised to integrate OCamlXARM into  <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">OPAM</a>, the OCaml package manager. I&rsquo;ll be getting to these projects as soon as I can.</p>

<p>If you find problems with the compiler, I&rsquo;d be happy to hear about them. Or if you have any comments or encouragement, leave them below or email me at <a href="mailto:jeffsco@psellos.com">jeffsco@psellos.com</a>.</p>
