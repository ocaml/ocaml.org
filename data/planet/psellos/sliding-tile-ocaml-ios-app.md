<p>I revamped another OCaml iOS app from a few years ago to make it run
under iOS 8.3. It implements a sliding tile puzzle that was a fad in the
1880s and was also popular in my childhood a few years after that.</p>

<p>Instructions for downloading, building, and running the app are here:</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun with this puzzle as a kid, and I still find it
enjoyable to play with though it&rsquo;s not particularly challenging to
solve. To make the app more interesting, I coded up a heuristic search
that solves the puzzle.</p>

<p>Here are some insights I had while revamping the app:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>iOS devices have gotten tremendously faster since I wrote the code. I
should rewrite it to solve with fewer moves. I&rsquo;d really love to see
what an extremely short solution looks like. I&rsquo;ll bet it looks
impossibly wise, like those Swedish girls in First Aid Kit.</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s a little strange for a puzzle to solve itself. Like what if there
was a button on the jigsaw puzzle box that made the pieces crawl
themselves on the table into the solution. It would be fun to watch,
but would it be a puzzle any more? More like a garden I guess.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, reader, it&rsquo;s late at night and I have to rest up. There are
exciting new developments in the OCaml-on-iOS world to talk about in the
coming weeks. A version of the the iOS cross compiler, much improved
with help from the truly knowledgeable, and with support for 64-bit ARM,
will soon be available through OPAM. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this,
and indeed this is why I&rsquo;m working through these apps as fast as I can.
I&rsquo;m testing them against the new compiler.</p>
