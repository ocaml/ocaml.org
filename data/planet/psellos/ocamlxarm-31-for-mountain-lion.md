<p>For those interested in building iOS apps in OCaml 4, I&rsquo;ve just revamped
<a href="http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iphone.html">OCamlXARM 3.1</a> for the latest OS X
release, OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).  The only difference is in the
default iOS SDK, which I changed from iOS 5.1 to iOS 6.0.  Otherwise,
this was just a recompile.</p>

<p>You can get binary releases of OCamlXARM here:</p>

<ul class="rightoffloat">
<li><a href="http://psellos.com/pub/ocamlxarm/ocaml-4.00.0+xarm-3.1.7.dmg">OCamlXARM 3.1.7 for Lion</a></li>
<li><a href="http://psellos.com/pub/ocamlxarm/ocaml-4.00.0+xarm-3.1.8.dmg">OCamlXARM 3.1.8 for Mountain Lion</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For information on how to build from sources and how to test an
installation, see <a href="http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iphone.html">Compile OCaml for
iOS</a>.</p>

<p>My next plan is to make a Mountain Lion release of OCamlXSim, which will
build against the iOS 6 Simulator by default.</p>

<p>In the background I&rsquo;m trying to invent an iPad app that will encourage
you to live in the present moment.  An old friend suggests that it could
be based on managing a complex undertaking on-screen.  Say, something
like organizing eighty middle school kids as they perform a Motown
adaptation of <em>The Tempest</em>.  This is an intriguing idea, and the
soundtrack would be excellent.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m thinking that the app should focus more on <em>you</em> (the
person running the app).  I imagine that the app shows you on the
screen, and you can manipulate the image of yourself by touching and
dragging your arms and legs, etc.  In the app, your iPad is lost
somewhere in your house.  Your goal is to solve a series of logistical
puzzles to find the missing iPad, and then run the same app in the app
that you&rsquo;re running in real life.  If you succeed, there&rsquo;s a
time-tunnel-like graphic that transports you through a kaleidoscopic
hall of mirrors into the present moment.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, OCaml is such a powerful language it gives me great
ideas for apps.</p>
