<div><p class="noindent">
Following my previous post, some people <a href="https://www.donadeo.net/post/2010/my-new-blog-in-objective-caml#commentary">asked me</a> to show the source code of this blog, so here it is:<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/pdonadeo/personal_blog">https://github.com/pdonadeo/personal_blog</a>.</p>

<p>A general warning: the project wasn't thought to be published and so the code is a pile of scripts kept together in some way. Many parameters are present in the SQLite DB, but if you want to use the blog, expect to find my name, surname or email in the HTML templates, or even in some .ml files.</p>

<p>Moreover, the source code is not homogeneous and the style changes from module to module, because I changed my way (and skill) of programming in OCaml in time.</p>

<p>In any case, I hope you will find it interesting.</p></div>
