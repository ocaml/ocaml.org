<p class="noindent">A server I just deployed (written in OCaml, of course) seems to eat RAM at breakfast. This is the chart of the RSS field of &quot;ps&quot; in the past 24h (click to enlarge). The program starts with almost 6 Mb and is now reaching 40 Mb, in a linear trend that has nothing good to say.</p>

<p class="noindent">Any advice on how to debug the memory consumption?</p>
