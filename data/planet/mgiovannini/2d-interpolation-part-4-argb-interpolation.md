After linearizing all array accesses, interpolating ARGB values is easy from the algorithmic side of things; so easy things first. I'll handle the pixel interpolation proper by abstracting them away in their own little functions. Processing an ARGB source array is just a matter of changing the variable declarations:


final int[] srcpix = {
0xff0051ff, 0xff00fffb, 0xff9cff00, 0xff0051ff,
