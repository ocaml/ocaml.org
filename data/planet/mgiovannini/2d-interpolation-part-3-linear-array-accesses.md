Last time I've hoisted all accesses to the source array. This opens the door to being able to process linear arrays representing a matrix in row-major order by stenciling. Not only that, but I was able to completely eliminate the need to have a bordered array on input by explicitly replicating elements as needed. The first step is to use a row buffer into which to copy the elements to be
