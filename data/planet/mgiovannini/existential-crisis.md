In a long discussion at LtU, user Jules Jacobs advances a use-case that for him would have been difficult to solve in a statically-typed language. I focus on his first two points:



A data structure that is a container of T plus a function on T's. I would have needed existential types to hide the T, which I don't get in many languages.
A couple of functions that take heterogeneous list of items
