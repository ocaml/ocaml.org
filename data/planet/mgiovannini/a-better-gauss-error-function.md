If you do statistics you know of erf and erfc; if you work in OCaml you surely miss them. It is not very difficult to port the canonical implementation given by Numerical Recipes (which I won't show and not just for licensing reasons); if you Google for a coefficient you'll see that this approximation is, indeed, ubiquitous. There exists a better approximation in the literature, one that is more
