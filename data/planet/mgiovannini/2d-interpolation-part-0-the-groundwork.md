(First of a series) My process for going from a textbook implementation of an algorithm to an efficient production-grade version of it is to methodically apply meaning-preserving transformations that make the code progressively tighter. In this case I'll massage a na&iuml;ve 2D interpolator that selectively uses nearest-neighbor, bilinear and bicubic interpolation. I started by studying a basic
