Revisiting the post on Braun Trees I noticed that, while pedagogical, the implementation of the root replacement operation rep can be streamlined a bit. By inlining the mutually recursive siftdown, specializing on the matches and adding guards, the result is as follows:


let rec rep compare e = function
| N (_, (N (el, _, _) as l), E)
  when compare el e  &lt; 0 -&gt;
  N (el, rep compare e l, E)
| N
