While proving that every monad is an applicative functor, I extracted the following derivation as a lemma:


  fmap f &#8728; (&lambda;h. fmap h x)
&equiv; { defn. &#8728;, &beta;-reduction }
  &lambda;g. fmap f (fmap g x)
&equiv; { defn. &#8728; }
  &lambda;g. (fmap f &#8728; fmap g) x
&equiv; { Functor }
  &lambda;g. fmap (f &#8728; g) x
&equiv; { abstract f &#8728; g }
  &lambda;g. (&lambda;h. fmap h x) (f &#8728; g)
&equiv; { defn. &#8728;, &eta;-contraction }
  (&lambda;h. fmap h x) &#8728; (f &#8728;)


for all f, x. This is the Yoneda
