<p>OCamlCore joins the Caml Consortium. As professional user of OCaml and strong believer in functionnal programming, this was a natural move. The consortium will bring more visibility to our continuous action on the OCaml market. It also show the strong commitment of OCamlCore in OCaml. We hope that this will help INRIA team.</p>
