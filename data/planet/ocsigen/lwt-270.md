<p><a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/releases/tag/2.7.0">Lwt 2.7.0</a> was released today. This release aims to (1) improve communication between maintainers and users, and (2) prepare for (minor) <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/308">breaking changes</a> to some APIs in Lwt 3.0.0 (planned for April).</p>

<p>To this end:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lwt now uses deprecation warnings (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[@deprecated]</code>), especially for upcoming breaking changes. This required dropping support for OCaml 4.01.</li>
  <li>There is a gradual, communicative, conservative <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/293">process</a> for deprecation and breaking. Maintainers of packages in OPAM get <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/308">notified proactively</a>. If you have code not published in OPAM, watch the Lwt repo, recompile the code at least once in three months, or subscribe to the Lwt <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/309">announcements issue</a>.</li>
  <li>If a planned breaking change is a bad idea, please let the maintainers know when you see the warning.</li>
  <li>Lwt now uses <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. The major version will grow slowly but steadily, but this does not mean that the whole API is being redesigned or broken.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are releasing a package to OPAM that depends on Lwt, it is not
recommended to constrain Lwt to its current major version. A major
release of Lwt will break only a few APIs, and your package is likely
not to be affected &ndash; if it is, you will be notified. You may, however,
wish to constrain Lwt to a major version in your private or production
code.</p>

<h3>Additional changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The main OPAM package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lwt</code> is getting rid of some optional dependencies in 3.0.0, which are now installable through separate OPAM packages <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lwt_ssl</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lwt_glib</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lwt_react</code>. This is to reduce recompilation of Lwt when installing OPAM packages <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssl</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lablgtk</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">react</code>.</li>
  <li>Values of types <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a Lwt.t</code> are now called <em>promises</em> rather than <em>threads</em>. This should eliminate a lot of confusion for beginners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lwt 2.7.0 also has a number of more ordinary changes, such as bug fixes
and the addition of bindings to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writev</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readv</code>. See the <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/releases/tag/2.7.0">full
changelog</a>.</p>

<h3>Future work</h3>

<p>I am working on an all-new manual, including fully rewritten API documentation with examples. It should be ready towards the end of winter.</p>

<p>My hope is that all the above allows Lwt to be taken progressively into the future, at the same time making development more open and more humane.</p>
