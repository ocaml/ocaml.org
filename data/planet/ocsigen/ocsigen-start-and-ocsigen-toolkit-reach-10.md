<p>The Ocsigen team is very happy to announce the first release of two
major new projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://ocsigen.org/ocsigen-start/1.1.0/manual/intro">Ocsigen Start</a>: a Web/mobile application skeleton written with
Js_of_ocaml and Eliom. You can use this skeleton as a basis for
your own app, or to learn Web/mobile app development in OCaml.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://ocsigen.org/ocsigen-toolkit/">Ocsigen Toolkit</a>: a set of responsive widgets for your mobile
and Web applications in OCaml.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both projects are available via <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/">OPAM</a> and released under the
LGPL.</p>

<p>Before installing, you can try out a demo of Ocsigen Start. The demo
is available</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ocsigen.org/os/demo/">on the Web</a>;</li>
  <li>via the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.osdemo.mobile">Google Play store</a>;</li>
  <li>as an Android <a href="http://ocsigen.org/ocsigen-start/demo/osdemo.apk">APK file</a>; and</li>
  <li>as an <a href="http://ocsigen.org/ocsigen-start/demo/osdemo-ios.tgz">iOS application</a> to be installed via XCode.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ocsigen Start provides the basic features for user management
(registration, activation links, password recovery, etc.), and some
useful libraries.  Remove the parts you don&rsquo;t need for your own app.</p>

<p>Ocsigen Start also contains many examples of code: remote procedure
calls, push notifications from the server, reactive pages, database
interaction, session data, internationalization, and some widgets from
Ocsigen Toolkit.</p>

<p>Ocsigen Toolkit contains common widgets for mobile and Web apps,
written natively in OCaml and specifically designed for Eliom&rsquo;s
multi-tier and multi-platform programming style.  You can also use
them in client-only Js_of_ocaml programs.  Many new widgets will be
added in future versions.</p>

<p>Ocsigen Start and Ocsigen Toolkit are developed by the Ocsigen team at
<a href="https://www.besport.com/">Be Sport</a>, at the <a href="http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/">Paris Diderot University</a>, and at the
<a href="https://www.irill.org/">IRILL</a>.</p>
