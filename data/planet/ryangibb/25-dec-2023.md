        <ul>
<li>Added Let’s Encrypt Nameserver Daemon (<code>lend</code>) and client
(<code>lenc</code>) to eon, which provisions TLS certs with the ACME DNS
challenge inside the nameserver modifying the trie directly.
<ul>
<li>Required porting ocaml/letsencrypt to Eio 0.12.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added a Capnp RPC interface to provision certificates using this
creating Let’s Encrypt Nameserver Cap’n Proto (<code>lenscap</code>).
There’s still work to do including supporting renewals with capnp
callbacks which will probably require sturdy refs, the story for which
persisting seems complicated.</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2023/12/19/standards-and-centralization">RFC9518</a>
on the train up to Scotland.
<ul>
<li>It talks about how technical decentralisation is necessary but not
sufficient. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9518.html#name-federation">Section
3.1</a> talks about issues with federation in the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc22-holzbauer.pdf">centralisation
of SMTP providers</a> and how XMPP federation is voluntary. Matrix
bridges are an interesting form of involuntary federation as is playing
out with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/14/apple-again-targets-imessage-on-android-app-beeper-but-company-claims-it-has-a-fix/">Apple
and Matrix-based Beeper right now</a>.</li>
