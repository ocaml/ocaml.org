<li><p><span><span class="done DONE">X</span> Wrote <a href="https://tangled.sh/@ryan.freumh.org/caledonia">Caledonia</a>, a
Command-line Calendar Client</span></p></li>
<li><p><span><span class="done DONE">X</span> There’s been
renewed interest in upstreaming my <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5982">NixOS depext mechanism
for Opam</a>, which creates a Nix environment which Opam manages to
provide system dependencies, and was one of the original ideas behind <a href="https://ryan.freumh.org/enki.html">Enki</a>, so I’ve been polishing that up this
week.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span><span class="done DONE">X</span> I deployed the
<a href="https://repology.org/">repology</a> database locally and got
some queries working on it. It’s a great data source, and will hopefully
be useful in ‘unifying’ packages present in multiple ecosystems using <a href="https://github.com/repology/repology-rules">repology’s
deduplication rules</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>It doesn’t contain rich metadata for packages,
though. It scrapes sources of data for package names and versions (e.g.
Opam’s <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/json/stats.json">https://opam.ocaml.org/json/stats.json</a>,
Nix’s <a href="https://channels.nixos.org">https://channels.nixos.org</a>, and
Debian’s <a href="https://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/">https://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/</a>,
through <a href="https://github.com/repology/repology-updater/">https://github.com/repology/repology-updater/</a>).
So it doesn’t have metadata like Opam package authors (nevermind
dependency constraints).</span></p></li>
<li><p><span><span class="done DONE">X</span> While looking
into repology I found their <a href="https://github.com/repology/libversion-rs">Rust libversion</a>
implementation, which could be useful to replace my <a href="https://github.com/RyanGibb/enki/blob/main/enki_solver/src/version.rs">version
implementation</a>, but I’m not sure if it’s</span></p></li>
<li><p><span><span class="done DONE">X</span> I read <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/nix-by-hand/">Nix by Hand</a>,
which got my thinking about how <a href="https://ryan.freumh.org/enki.html">Enki</a> could
interact with the Nix store without going through Nix
expressions.</span></p>
<p><span>The Nix ecosystem appears to be experiencing a bit
of a cambrian explosion at the moment so this is something to keep an
eye on with all the alternative implementations going about. Watch <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/134/">RFC 0134 Carve out a
store-only Nix</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7868">Tracking issue for RFC
134.</a> Also see the <a href="https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix-store">Haskell Nix
Store</a>.`</span></p></li>
