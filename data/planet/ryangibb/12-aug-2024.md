<li><p><span>trying to modify the zeroinstall solver to
support solving multiple versions for e.g. cargo</span></p>

<p><span>where does the CUDF conflict between multiple
versions of the same package come from?</span></p>
<p><span>so the fundamental problem here is we have
different solving semantics for different parts of the dependency
tree</span></p>
<p><span>I wonder if it would be possible to have a depth
first search for cargoâ€™s portion of the dependency tree, and sat solving
for the rest</span></p></li>

<p><span>okay, what if we just modify the version impls to
have different roles for every cargo package</span></p>
<p><span>0install solver for cargo packages</span></p></li>
