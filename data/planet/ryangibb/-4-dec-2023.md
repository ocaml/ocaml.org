        <ul>
<li>Arrived in Cambridge and finialised my HotNets presentation adding
some new slides to expand on how existing DNS mechanisms like DNS-SD can
interoperate, illustrating the interface to a geodetic query, etc.</li>
<li>Attended the HotNets Conference.</li>
<li>Met with Jane Street.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HotNets Conference</h2>
<p><span>It was great!</span></p>
<h3>Feedback on the SNS</h3>
<p><span>First and foremost, I recieved
some really useful questions, thoughts, and feedback on the
SNS.</span></p>
<p><span>While presenting I was
asked:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Joshua Smith, Uni of Washington:
<ul>
<li>Q: does this support mobile device?</li>
<li>A: that is not our primary use case with these device with their
functional primarily defined by their location, though a limitted form
of mobility could be supported through existing mechanisms like
CNAMEs.</li>
<li>Q: what about devices that are inbetween… sometimes static and
sometime mobile, e.g.&nbsp;food trucks.</li>
<li>A: maybe if we didn’t use use locations to name device, but rather
as a query mechanism, we could.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hari Balakrishnan, MIT:
<ul>
<li>Q: how can you manage controlling device’s communication with each
other without control over scanning?</li>
<li>A: well, we can implement that at the application layer</li>
<li>Q: what about exposing devices existiance?</li>
<li>A: we can use split-horizon DNS as a coarse grained form of access
control</li>
<li>Q: what about authenticated with identity? (implicit instead of
location)</li>
<li>A: maybe we could retrofit a more sophisticated and fine-grained
form of access control onto the DNS</li>
<li>Q: let’s follow up…</li>
<li>The next day.</li>
<li>Q: other device discovery mechanisms like airdrop exposes only to
contacts / devices on the same wifi network, but the DNS is public. Is
the DNS the right way to expose devices to a specific identity.</li>
<li>A: The primary use case is static shared devices that you don’t care
about exposing the existance of, e.g.&nbsp;printers. But if we could augment
the DNS for this kind of identity-based access control, then there’s no
reason why not. And get a lot of benefits from extending the and
interoperating with the DNS.</li>
<li>NB: Apparantly the INS had some kind of scheme for this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Didn’t catch their name, MIT I think:
<ul>
<li>Q: have you made life more difficult for yourself by trying to solve
this globally? E.g. this access control. What if it was just deployed in
a trusting MIT network</li>
<li>A: yes probably, but also this will globally interoperate with the
entire Internet for end-to-end connectivity. This is HotNets… let’s
think big!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Then, over email:</span></p>

&gt;&gt; Yes! I can't remember if I mentioned it, but my script contained:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; We emphasise that this is just one possible scheme, however, and
&gt;&gt; alternatives such as R-trees may be more efficient for sparse locations.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We haven't built this in anger yet, but I think when we do it'll
&gt;&gt; inform which to use
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Was wondering, beyond Hilbert curves, if you've thought about other
&gt;&gt;&gt; geospatial indexing data structures? It would be cool to articulate
&gt;&gt;&gt; which makes a better fit for the DNS context.</code></pre>
<p><span>At the end of my session, “The
architecture of the Internet, and datacenter networks.” there was a
panel with all the presenters. It seemed hard for people to find
cross-cutting questions as what is relevant to CDNs and datacentres
doesn’t have a lot of overlap with naming physical locations. But one
question asked the panel chair was on the benefits of and challenges
with application level integrations into these systems. My co-panelists
didn’t have anything to say on this, so I made the point that the INS
had much a much richer query language for expressing names that allowed
for better integration with applications (e.g.&nbsp;give me a camera with
this specific resolution), but didn’t maintain backwards compatiblty
with existing systems (DNS). This is a fudamental challenege in evolving
the Internet architecture due to protocol ossification. A key tenent of
the SNS is interoperating with existing DNS protocols and
applications.</span></p>
<p><span>A number of people mentioned
what3words, including Vinod Yegneswaran from SRI and Innocent Obi from
Uni of Washington. I said that this is just one possible (propretiary,
and as Chris Jensen pointed out in the CL fraught with issues)
geocoding.</span></p>
<p><span>Boris Kodehofe had some
comments on P2P name lookup namespces, LDAP and other directory
services, He was confused about the geodetic resolution and hilbert
curves because he thought this was a layer on top of the DNS somehow,
but I clarified this was just a query mechanism interoperating with the
DNS. It’s worth making clear the hilbert curves are just an indexing
mechanism in future (and other spatial datastructures may be better
e.g.&nbsp;R-Trees). He also he uses naming as an example of a distrubted
system in his courses.</span></p>
<p><span>Innocent Obi liked the global
and local resolution. He talked about work he is aware of in Africa in
creating digital addresses for otherwise ‘unaddressed’ places. This is
another issue with civic encodings… Some of the P2P networking and store
and forward stuff was remanisent of Haggle. We also talked about
differential privacy as spatial location tells you a lot (K-anonymity
for spatial privacy). He recommended finding undergrads of masters to
delegeate ideas to. A lot of the telephony location service have been
tried to be retrofitted to the Internet with the IETF Geopriv working
group.</span></p>
<p><span>After these conversations on
the first day, I had a thought: what if the civic location heirarchy was
just another mechanism to query canonical names?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Like geodetic queries, a query could be made to a <code>_loc</code>
subdomain, e.g.&nbsp;<code>fn06._loc.cl.cam.ac.uk</code> (or a global
<code>_loc</code> TLD). This could return a CNAME for a matching record,
e.g.&nbsp;<code>phone.ryan.freumh.org</code> (or multiple matches in TXT
records, as multiple CNAMES breaks the DNS spec).</li>
<li>This would support mobility to the degree that the DNS already does
with e.g.&nbsp;dynamic DNS, opening up the devices it could be applicable too
mobile and personal devices (pending access control issues… perhaps
related to signpost).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some people I met</h3>
<ul>
<li>Innocent Obi, Uni of Washington
<ul>
<li>From the SNS query privacy issue spoke about ODNS, ODoH, and
DoDO.</li>
<li>Someone in his lab was the intern who wrote the ODoH paper during an
internship at Cloudflare.</li>
<li>He said I should reach out to Marwan to see if they’re running this
year, and to think about what would you if given access to Cloudflare’s
network.</li>
<li>He also said Network Operator Groups (NOGs) are interesting places
to see real-world network deployment converstations.</li>
<li>He is interested in the shape of the network e.g.&nbsp;BGP routes in
Africa, which lacks a testbed lab like NA’s Cloud lab or EU’s Geni</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Xi Jiang (Jason), Uni of Chicago
<ul>
<li>Presented ‘Generative, High-Fidelity Network Traces’ and Supervised
by Nick Feamster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fabbian Ruffus, New York University
<ul>
<li>Works with Gianni Antichi</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gianni Antichi, Politecnico di Milano and Queen Mary University of
London
<ul>
<li>We watched the virtual HotNets together in Cambridge in 2021 and we
reunited in Boston!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Malte Schwarzkopf, Brown University
<ul>
<li>Gave him his clothes, had a chat, and he introduced me to some
people incl Pouya Hamadanian at MIT, someone at MS research working on
photonic computing, and Jeffrey Mogul.</li>
<li>He invited me to give a talk at Brown sometime as he missed my
presentation due to teaching obligations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hari Balakrishnan, MIT
<ul>
<li>General chair and had some comments on the SNS, given his background
in the INS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thomas Krenc, CAIDA
<ul>
<li>Didn’t get to speak much as I was presenting next.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Boris Koldehofe
<ul>
<li>Presented ‘The Future is Analog: Energy-Efficient Cognitive Network
Functions over Memristor-Based Analog Computations’.</li>
<li>Will Sussman, very energetic PhD student at MIT
<ul>
<li>Has a ‘citymesh’ idea of a P2P network of wireless access points,
but it got rejected from HotNets due to a lack of novelty (MANETS etc
have been doing this for years).</li>
<li>They were interested in the SNS as they have a similar issue of
wanting to say resolve an email address (a name) to a location (like DNS
loc records, the inverse of the SNS).</li>
<li>Propigating this routing and naming information seems
challenging.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Qiao Xiang who’s on the ACME cs2024 computer science curricula
committee <a href="https://csed.acm.org/">https://csed.acm.org/</a></li>
<li>Fernando Ramas who was also supervised by Jon asked me to give him
the best of luck.</li>
<li>James Larisch, who gave the Root Store talk, when talking about
DNSSEC, said there was a paper <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-chung.pdf">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-chung.pdf</a>
that I might be interested in.</li>
<li>Adrian Zapletai, Delft University of Technology
<ul>
<li>A nice fellow second year who gave a presentation on a new metric
for equity in fair queueing based on flow lengths.</li>

<p><span>We talked about how JS deploys
software for a while, and the issues facing them migrating to Nix. It
seems to consist of copying statically linked binaries around for the
most part. They do not think containers are a solution to this software
deployment problem, that is just another way of copying binaries around
– the real issue is managing dependancies. Nix provides an integrated
dependancy management and sofware deployment framework that they seem to
be keen on. Issues facing it’s deployment seem to be boostrapping their
monorepo’s build.</span></p>

written with @avsm and @tforcworc (<a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_gibb.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_gibb.pdf</a>).</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll be live blogging the
conference along the way if you’re not attending but want to keep
informed about what’s happening starting with,</span></p>
<p><span>Session 1: On the process of
research’!</span></p>
<p><span>Hugo Sadok presented “Of
Apples and Oranges: Fair Comparisons in Heterogenous Systems
Evaluation”.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>CPU + accelerators are often unfairly compared to CPU +
accelerators, when a more fair comparison might be against CPU +
CPU</li>
<li>new hardware should consider cost as well as performance</li>
<li>how to pick a good cost metric?</li>
<li>costs should be context-independent, quantifiable, and have
end-to-end coverage</li>
<li>some practical costs might be power, rack-space, no. of cores or
LUTs</li>
</ul>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_sadok.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_sadok.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>some questions
were:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>costs are also multidimensonal, how to choose the cost?
<ul>
<li>answer: we should come together as a community</li>
</ul></li>
<li>why does context dependancy matter, why not use cost?
<ul>
<li>answer: it’s not reproducible</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Jeffrey Mogul presented
“Physical Deployability Matters”.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>can we deployed a network in the real physical world at scale</li>
<li>some concerns: racks, power and cooling, cables, components, repair,
safe for humans, probability of errors</li>
<li>a datacentre is always under construction</li>
<li>at scale, this change must be automated with humans doing the
physical work, but software deciding what to do</li>
<li>how to get better: design for evolution and restore the “digital
twins” concept</li>
</ul>

<p><span>Philip Levis presented “A Case
Against CXL Memory Pooling”.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>big bunch of memory
attached for servers with CXL pool, ‘far memory’</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>caveats: if these things
change, and there are other uses of CXL e.g.&nbsp;NICS or memory
stores</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>CXL is a replacement for
PCIe: reduces latency and has cache coherence</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>CXL performance: good
bandwidth, but high latency for memory <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15375.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15375.pdf</a></span></p></li>
<li><p><span>cost: reduces RAM, but a
CXL pool has a cost (MRSP). A pool breaks even at 140TB RAM, ignoring
racking, cabling, etc</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>complexity: CXL latency
is a big problem, it means you need to rewrite your
software</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>bin packing is easy when
the bins (modern servers) are small; if you have a big knapsack and a
bunch of small items, just throw them all in</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span>questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>why not rewrite software?
<ul>
<li>transferring large blocks of memory, that’s fine, but if I have a
hash table, it doesn’t work very well</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_levis.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_levis.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>Emmanuel Amaro presented
“Logical memory pools: Flexible and local disaggregated
memory”.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>CXL enables hardware memory dissaggregation</li>
<li>logical memory pools have benefits over physical pools</li>
</ul>
<p><span>question: - coherency? - RDA?
way cheaper - we do we need a coherent new fabric</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_amaro.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_amaro.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>Panel on Session 1: On the
process of research.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>Malte Schwarzkopf: There
is a role for researchers to play if only we could figure out some of
these costs or deployability issues. It’s not a static issue, if
researchers come up with a new solution like a static memory pool then
maybe google can use it. Costs go down as technology becomes popular.
Researchers can come up with ideas that are not immediately feasible
today, but could be if some of these variables change.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>When does it make sense
to move on to the new technology. Adopting new things is hard and
requires work. Adopting new things is good and give us performance
questions. Related to when should be rewrite our applications question,
and Malte’s question.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Hari Balakrishnan on
datacentres. Started in the 60s with mainframes, PCs, mobile, cloud.
Sensitive about data and where it resides. Are mega-scale datacentre the
future, or are smaller more decentralised datacentres the way forward
like CPCs.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Session 2: Can LLMs reason
about networking problems, and their solution?</span></p>
<p><span>Yajie Zhou presented “Towards
Interactive Research Agents for Internet Incident Investigation“ using
GPT as a domain expert.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_zhou.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_zhou.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>Prakhar Sharma is presenting
“PROSPER: Extracting Protocol Specifications Using Large Language
Models” seems really interesting – extracting a formal specification of
a protocol from RFCs.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_sharma.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_sharma.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note the DNS has an unusually
high number of false negatives due to ‘specific symbols that aren’t
included in the algorithm’. If they are included, the false positive
rate goes up.</span></p>
<p><span>Guess my job is safe! For
now…</span></p>
<p><span>My session, ‘Session 3: The
architecture of the Internet, and datacenter networks,’ is
next!</span></p>
<p><span>Katerina Argyraki is kicking
us off with ‘Caching and Neutrality’.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_abdullah.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_abdullah.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>Just presented the “Where on
Earth is the Spatial Name System?” and got some engaging questions
including on: - mobility - access control and device existence privacy -
and geospatial indexing structures</span></p>
<p><span>In ‘Session 4: Measure twice,
solve once’ Aryan Taneja presented “Don’t Forget the User: It’s Time to
Rethink Network Measurements” and Catalina Alvarez presented “Learning a
QoE Metric from Social Media and Gaming Footage” looking to the
end-users to inform metrics of the network.</span></p>
<p><span>Really interesting paper on
using high bandwidth and low latency channels concurrently and how that
propagates up the stack to be exposed to the application layer in
‘Session 5: Beam me up, Scotty!’.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_touseef.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_touseef.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>Another HoloLens spotted; Bo
Han’s using semantic communication to reduce the network cost of
holographic communication in ‘Enriching Telepresence with
Semantic-driven Holographic Communication’. This is my favourite session
so far!</span></p>
<p><span>Kicking off day 2 of HotLL… –
sorry, HotNets – we have a ‘Session 6: Can LLMs Manage
Networks?’.</span></p>
<p><span>George Varghese asks ‘How can
LLMs work with Verifiers?’ with a feedback loop inspired by Ramanujan
and Hardy’s theorising and verifying loop.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_mondal.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_mondal.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>In ‘Session 7: What should we
worry about when managing congestion?’ Adrian Zapletal proposes
optimizing for flow completion times instead of flow rate fairness –
equity over fairness. Serhat Arslan took a very similar approach, ‘full
speed then idle’ over ‘instantaneous fairness’ to improve the energy
usage of congestion control algorithms.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_zapletal.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_zapletal.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>‘How I Learned to Stop
Worrying About CCA Contention’ led to a spirited discussion on whether
congestion control algorithm contention is a real issue. Akshay Narayan
posits that congestion control algorithm contention is not an issue in
practice and had anecdotal observations to support this.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_brown.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_brown.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>Opponents said that it is
important for new applications with higher bandwidth requirements
(recall ‘Enriching Telepresence with Semantic-driven Holographic
Communication’), resource-constrained environments (e.g.&nbsp;developing
countries and on transport), when links go down, and just because it’s
not been observed doesn’t mean it’s not occurring.</span></p>
<p><span>In session ‘Session 8: New
hardware for new networks’ Haoda Wang presented ‘Mars Attacks! Software
Protection Against Space Radiation’ using commodity hardware in space
with software mechanism for protection against radiation-caused
bit-flips.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_wang.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_wang.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>In the final sesion ‘Session
9: Who keeps us safe…?’ Emma Dauterman reconsiders the design of the web
from a privacy-first perspective using a private Key-Value store
distributed in a CDN to avoid traffic-analysis
de-anonymisation.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_dauterman.pdf">https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/papers/hotnets23_dauterman.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span>And James Larisch concluded
with a proposal to shift the responsibility of assigning domain names
which certificate authorities are authorised to sign from the CA’s
themselves to root stores, proposing General Certificate Constraints to
replace name-restrictions. I had an interesting chat with him about the
role of CA’s and whether using DNSSEC DANE to distribute TLS
certificates is a viable alternative.</span></p>

<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p><span>How to listen to
presentations?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>It can be quite draining to listen to presentations all day,
especially in areas you’re not all too familiar with.</li>
<li>Some mechanism for staying engaged I’ve found to work are:
<ul>
<li>Get outside for a short walk a few times throughout the day. And
sleep well, stay hydrated, eat healthy, etc.</li>
<li>Consider how the topic could related to your work, vice versa, or
how you might use or work on it otherwise.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Some notes on giving
presentations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare by practising more and internalise the script you’re
written</li>
<li>Less is more – going into detail on one particular aspect is better
than giving a shallow coverage of everything</li>
<li>Your audience is likely distracted – most good presenters are just
reiterating the same 3 or so points again and again</li>
<li>Tell a story, you want to engage your audience.</li>
<li>Put bullet point notes on the presentation – a full script is useful
for planning but not of much use in giving an engaging presentation</li>
</ul>
