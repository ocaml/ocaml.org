        <p><span>I deployed Eon certificate provisioning to my
server to my server, and promptly got rate limited by Let’s Encrypt
(staging). It was a combination of not limiting the amount of concurrent
certificates being provisioned and a bug in the Cap’n Proto OCaml RPC
Eio port that Patrick purportedly has a <a href="https://github.com/patricoferris/capnp-rpc/commit/6c95e771eb1345dcc6d31b959b1a5a8ca45e8a92">fix</a>
for. I’ve ended up using systemd services <a href="https://github.com/RyanGibb/eon/blob/a831b4fdfa54767edf439047e87564a883c099eb/acme.nix#L219-L227">extensively</a>
to support provisioning certificates.</span></p>
<p><span>I also added a CalDAV server to Eilean.</span></p>
