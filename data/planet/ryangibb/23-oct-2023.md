        <h2>HotNets, HotNets, HotNets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t try and rewrite your whole paper a day before the
deadline.</li>
<li>Got it in, and need to think about travel and accomadation
next.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2023/program.html">program</a>
has been published, and I’m on the first day at 1:15pm - 2:45pm in
‘Session 3: The architecture of the Internet, and datacenter
networks’.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SIGCOMM SNS</h2>
<p><span>Magnus and I threw some ideas around on
Thurday morning. Apple’s ARKit might be something to look at in lieu of
a Vision Pro. We also discussed getting some experience with iPhone’s
lidar precision, how to bootstrap a connection, the issues with civic
name encodings, and the necessity to get some estimation of
load.</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding an implementation, once we
have a bit more of an idea of what it might look like, <a href="https://github.com/RyanGibb/aeon">github.com/RyanGibb/aeon</a>
would be a good starting point.</span></p>

<h2>OCaml Wake-on-Lan</h2>
<p><span>Following up on <a href="https://ryan.freumh.org/2023-10-16.html#hibernia">hibernia</a>, I created an <a href="https://github.com/RyanGibb/ocaml-wake-on-lan/">OCaml
implementation</a> of the Magic Packet format for the Wake-on-Lan (WoL)
standard.</span></p>
<h2>Malte Visit</h2>
<p><span>Spoke to Malte about the Spatial Name
System paper. He made some interesting points around the benefit of
expressing a concise problem statement. I expressed a multi-problem
on:</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Local-first connectivity</li>
<li>Low latency resolution</li>
<li>Resolving locations</li>
<li>Interoperate with existing network protocols</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Malte thought No. 1 was must compelling
using Facebook’s DNS/BGP meltdown resulting in lack of access to
physical infrastructure as a motivating case. He was fine with the idea
of a global onthology of civic heirarchy of names.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s interesting to see different
people’s objections to this. Keshav’s was the lack of a succinct problem
statement. Ian Lewis’ was the difficulty in defining a global ontology
of devices. And Malte’s was in the neccessity of low latency
operation.</span></p>
<h2>SRG Seminars</h2>
<p><span>I’m still the de-facto organiser of
the SRG seminars as no one was found to replace me. I should send out an
email to try and recruit a replacement.</span></p>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
