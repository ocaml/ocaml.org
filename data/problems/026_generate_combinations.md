# Solution

```ocaml
# let rec extract k list =
    if k <= 0 then [[]]
    else match list with
         | [] -> []
         | h :: tl ->
            let with_h = List.map (fun l -> h :: l) (extract (k - 1) tl) in
            let without_h = extract k tl in
            with_h @ without_h;;
val extract : int -> 'a list -> 'a list list = <fun>
```

# Statement

Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list.

In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12
people? We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K)
denotes the well-known binomial coefficients). For pure mathematicians,
this result may be great. But we want to really generate all the
possibilities in a list.

```ocaml
# extract 2 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"];;
- : string list list =
[["a"; "b"]; ["a"; "c"]; ["a"; "d"]; ["b"; "c"]; ["b"; "d"]; ["c"; "d"]]
```
