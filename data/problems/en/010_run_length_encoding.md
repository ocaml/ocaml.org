# Solution

```ocaml
# let encode list =
    let rec aux count acc = function
      | [] -> [] (* Can only be reached if original list is empty *)
      | [x] -> (count + 1, x) :: acc
      | a :: (b :: _ as t) -> if a = b then aux (count + 1) acc t
                              else aux 0 ((count + 1, a) :: acc) t in
    List.rev (aux 0 [] list);;
val encode : 'a list -> (int * 'a) list = <fun>
```

An alternative solution, which is shorter but requires more memory, is to use
the `pack` function declared in problem 9:

```ocaml
# let pack list =
    let rec aux current acc = function
      | [] -> []    (* Can only be reached if original list is empty *)
      | [x] -> (x :: current) :: acc
      | a :: (b :: _ as t) ->
         if a = b then aux (a :: current) acc t
         else aux [] ((a :: current) :: acc) t  in
    List.rev (aux [] [] list);;
val pack : 'a list -> 'a list list = <fun>
# let encode list =
    List.map (fun l -> (List.length l, List.hd l)) (pack list)
val encode : 'a list -> (int * 'a) list = <fun>
```

# Statement

If you need so, refresh your memory about
[run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding).

Here is an example:

```ocaml
# encode ["a"; "a"; "a"; "a"; "b"; "c"; "c"; "a"; "a"; "d"; "e"; "e"; "e"; "e"];;
- : (int * string) list =
[(4, "a"); (1, "b"); (2, "c"); (2, "a"); (1, "d"); (4, "e")]
```
