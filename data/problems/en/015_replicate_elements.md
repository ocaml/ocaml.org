# Solution

```ocaml
# let replicate list n =
    let rec prepend n acc x =
      if n = 0 then acc else prepend (n-1) (x :: acc) x in
    let rec aux acc = function
      | [] -> acc
      | h :: t -> aux (prepend n acc h) t in
    (* This could also be written as:
       List.fold_left (prepend n) [] (List.rev list) *)
    aux [] (List.rev list);;
val replicate : 'a list -> int -> 'a list = <fun>
```

> Note that `List.rev list` is needed only because we want `aux` to be
> [tail recursive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call).
