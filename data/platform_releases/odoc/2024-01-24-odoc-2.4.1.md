  ### Fixed

  - Revert to outputing a file (without content) when rendering a hidden
    compilation unit. This fixes cases where the dune rules would
    fail. (@panglesd, #1069)

The release of `odoc` 2.4.0 last month introduced a regression that caused Dune rules to fail in some cases. This release of `odoc` 2.4.1 fixes this issue.
