        *   Signature help should not appear on the function name ([#1997](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1997))
        *   Fix completion not working for inlined records labels ([#1978](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1978), fixes [#1977](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1977))
        *   Perform buffer indexing only if the query requires it ([#1990](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1990) and [#1991](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1991))
        *   Stop unnecessarily forcing substitutions when initializing short-paths graph ([#1988](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1988))

        *   Add a test to ensure the behavior showed in issue [#1517](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1517) is no longer relevant ([#1995](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1995))
        *   Add a test to ensure the code fragment exhibited in issue [#1118](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1118) no longer makes Merlin crash ([#1996](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1996))

        *   Add a test reproducing issue [#1983](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1983) where `document` command which sometime concatenates consecutive variants and labels ([#2005](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/2005))
        *   Signature-help should trigger on unfinished `let ... in` bindings ([#2009](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/2009))

We're happy to announce the release of merlin `v5.6.1-504`!

This latest release brings performance optimizations, refined editor behavior, and improved stability to your OCaml development environment.

### **Key Improvements**

* **Smarter Signature Help:** Now triggers correctly on unfinished `let ... in` bindings and no longer appears redundantly on function names.
* **More Reliable Completion:** Fixed issues with completion for **inlined record labels**.
* **Improved Performance:** Optimized buffer indexing and path calculations to ensure Merlin remains fast and responsive during heavy editing.
* **Bug Fixes:**
  * Resolved a bug where the `document` command concatenated labels and variants incorrectly.
  * Fixed various minor issues in the underlying C code and added regression tests to prevent previous crashes from returning.
