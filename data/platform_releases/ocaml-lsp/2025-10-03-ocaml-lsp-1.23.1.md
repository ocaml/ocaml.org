We're happy to announce the release of `ocaml-lsp-server` 1.23.1!

This maintenance release fixes three key issues:

- **Method hover now works**: Hovering over object method calls now correctly displays type information instead of showing "No information available"
- **OCamllex files open without errors**: Fixed an error that occurred when opening `.mll` (OCamllex lexer) files in editors like NeoVim
- **Yojson compatibility**: Ensures the language server works with both yojson 2.0 and 3.0

Update via opam: `opam update && opam upgrade ocaml-lsp-server`
