_Feedback on this post is welcomed on [Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-publish-2-7-0/17358)!_

We are happy to announce the release of opam-publish 2.7.0 which brings the ability to more easily publish your releases automatically, thanks to [@filipeom](https://github.com/filipeom):
- SSH keys aren't used to push the branch to the user's fork anymore. Instead the token we already require is used.
- If undefined, the git config variables `user.name` and `user.email` are automatically filled with the github username and username@opam-publish as a backup

An example of the new automated setup can be found in [this CI job](https://github.com/formalsec/smtml/commit/3c98cc024583e69b87c6d63a233abff149471399).

Other minor changes include:
- The switch from `lwt_ssl` to `tls-lwt` which avoid one dependency and avoid depending on the system libssl

Happy publishing!
