    CHANGES:

    *   Make Ast\_builder's default `value_binding` constructor generate the proper  
        `pvb_constraint` from the pattern and expression arguments.  
        ([#589](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib/pull/589), [@NathanReb](https://github.com/NathanReb))
    *   Fix pprintast to output correct syntax from `Ppat_constraint (pat, Ptyp_poly ...)`  
        nodes until they are completely dropped. ([#588](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib/pull/588), [@NathanReb](https://github.com/NathanReb))

We're pleased to announce `ppxlib` 0.36.2, a maintenance release with two bug fixes related to OCaml 5.2 AST changes for type constraints in let bindings.

## What's Fixed

**Ast_builder compatibility**: The `value_binding` constructor now automatically handles the AST migration from OCaml 4.14 to 5.2, correctly generating `pvb_constraint` fields when type constraints are present. This means PPX authors don't need to manually update their code for the new AST representation.

**PPrintast output**: Fixed pretty-printing of legacy `Ppat_constraint` nodes with `Ptyp_poly` to produce valid OCaml syntax, ensuring generated code remains compilable during the transition period.

Both fixes improve compatibility across OCaml compiler versions.
