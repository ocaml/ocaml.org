After an extended summer break, the release of OCaml 5.4.0 is getting close.

Since there have been a handful of meaningful bug fixes this summer, we are releasing a second beta version of OCaml 5.4.0 to help you update your software and libraries ahead of the release (see below for the installation instructions). More information about the whole release process is now available in the [compiler repository](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/release-info/introduction.md).

Compared to the first beta release, this beta release contains four notable bug fixes:

- one type system bugfix for variance annotation on private types
- one memory concurrency safety fix for weak pointers
- two Windows fixes

Those fixes are complemented by:

- one runtime performance fix
- three tools and compiler-libs related fixes
- one error message fix.

The full list of fixes for this second beta is available below.

Overall, this beta release is already quite stable. If the tests for this beta release go well, we are expecting to have a first release candidate in the week of the 22 September, and the full release in the beginning of October.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

The last progresses on stabilising the ecosystem are still tracked on the [opam readiness for 5.4.0 meta-issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/27916).

If you are interested in full list of features and bug fixes of the new OCaml version, the updated change log for OCaml 5.4.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.4/Changes).

Happy hacking,  
Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:

```
opam update
opam switch create 5.4.0~beta2
```

The source code for the beta is also available at these addresses:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.4.0-beta2.tar.gz)
- [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.4/ocaml-5.4.0~beta2.tar.gz)

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.4.0~beta2+options <option_list>
```

where `option_list` is a space separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a flambda and no-flat-float-array switch:

```
opam switch create 5.4.0~beta2+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.4.0~beta2+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
