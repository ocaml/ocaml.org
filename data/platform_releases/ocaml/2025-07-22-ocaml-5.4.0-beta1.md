    ### Code generation fixes

    - **(breaking change)** [#13050](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13050), [#14104](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14104), +[#14143](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14143): Use '$' instead of '.' to separate module names in symbol names on macOS and Windows (including the Cygwin backend). This changes mangling of OCaml identifiers on those operating systems from `camlModule.name_NNN` to `camlModule$name_NNN`. Additionally it changes the encoding of special characters from `$xx` (two hex digits) to `$$xx` (two dollar signs followed by two hex digits).

- 5.4.0-beta1
---

Two months after the release of the first alpha for OCaml 5.4.0, the release of OCaml 5.4.0 is drawing near.

The internal API of the compiler libraries has been frozen, and most core developer tools support (or will support soon) the new version of the compiler.
We have thus released a first beta version of OCaml 5.4.0 to help you update your softwares and libraries ahead of the release (see below for the installation instructions).

Compared to the first alpha release, this beta release brings two notable changes. First, this beta partially reverts the changes of symbol names in executable (in order to keep current version of perf working with OCaml executable). Second, this beta fixes a significant performance issue on Apple Silicon macOS.

Beyond these two changes, this first beta release contains a dozen of small bug fixes (from the runtime to the error messages) which is usual for the stage of the release. We are expecting the release candidate to follow this beta release soon in the beginning of August.

The progresses on stabilising the ecosystem are tracked on the [opam readiness for 5.4.0 meta-issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/27916).

The full release is expected in the middle of August, see the [new prospective calendar](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/release-info/calendar.md) for more information.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [OCaml's issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues).

If you are interested in full list of features and bug fixes of the new OCaml version, the updated change log for OCaml 5.4.0 is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.4/Changes).

Happy hacking,
Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team

## Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.4.0~beta1
```

The source code for the beta is also available at these addresses:

### Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.4.0~beta1+options <option_list>
```

where `option_list` is a space separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a flambda and no-flat-float-array switch:

```bash
opam switch create 5.4.0~beta1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.4.0~beta1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
```

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.
