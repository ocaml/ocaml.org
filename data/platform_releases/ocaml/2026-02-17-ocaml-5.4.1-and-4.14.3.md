    configure-time to avoid using this feature with toolchains that do not support
    it (eg FreeBSD/Darwin); backport from 5.3.
    (backport by Boris Dobroslavov, original fix by Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by
    Xavier Leroy, David Allsopp, Javier Chávarri, Anil Madhavapeddy)

    functions instead of quadratic

We have the pleasure of announcing the dual releases of OCaml 4.14.3 and OCaml 5.4.1, dedicated to the memory of Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn on the anniversary of his death.

Those releases are a collection of safe and valuable runtime bugfixes.
The OCaml 5.4.1 release also contains a fix for the `-pack` mode for macOs and various TSAN fixes.

More importantly, those new versions harden the Marshal module against malicious inputs as described in the security announcement [OSEC-2026-01](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/OSEC-2026-01).

We are encouraging you to switch to those new releases whenever possible.

Don't hesitate to [report any bugs](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues) on the OCaml issue tracker and to [leave comments](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-5-4-1-and-4-14-3-released/17822) on the discuss announcement.

See the list of changes below for more details.

Happy hacking,
-- Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team.
