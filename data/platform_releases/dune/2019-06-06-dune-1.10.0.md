title: Dune 1.10.0
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Restricted the set of variables available for expansion in the destination
    filename of `install` stanza to simplify implementation and avoid dependency
    cycles. (#2073, @aalekseyev, @jeremiedimino)

  - [menhir] call menhir from context root build_dir (#2067, @ejgallego,
    review by @jeremiedimino, @rgrinberg)

  - [coq] Add `coq.pp` stanza to help with pre-processing of grammar
    files (#2054, @ejgallego, review by @rgrinberg)

  - Add a new more generic form for the *promote* mode: `(promote
    (until-clean) (into <dir>))` (#2068, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow to promote only a subset of the targets via `(promote (only
    <pred>))`. For instance: `(promote (only *.mli))` (#2068, @jeremiedimino)

  - Improve the behavior when a strict subset of the targets of a rule is already
    in the source tree for projects using the dune language < 1.10 (#2068, fixes
    #2061, @jeremiedimino)

  - With lang dune >= 1.10, rules in standard mode are no longer allowed to
    produce targets that are present in the source tree. This has been a warning
    for long enough (#2068, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow %{...} variables in pps flags (#2076, @mlasson review by @jeremiedimino and
    @aalekseyev).

  - Add a 'cookies' option to ppx_rewriter/deriver flags in library stanzas. This
    allow to specify cookie requests from variables expanded at each invocation of
    the preprocessor. (#2106, @mlasson @jeremiedimino)

  - Add more opam metadata and use it to generate `.opam` files. In particular, a
    `package` field has been added to specify package specific information.
    (#2017, #2091, @avsm, @jonludlam, @rgrinberg)

  - Clean up the special support for `findlib.dynload`. Before, Dune would simply
    match on the library name. Now, we only match on the findlib package name when
    the library doesn't come from Dune. Someone writing a library called
    `findlib.dynload` with Dune would have to add `(special_builtin_support
    findlib_dynload)` to trigger the special behavior. (#2115, @jeremiedimino)

  - Install the `future_syntax` preprocessor as `ocaml-syntax-shims.exe` (#2125,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Hide full command on errors and warnings in development and show them in CI.
    (detected using the `CI` environment variable). Commands for which the
    invocation might be omitted must output an error prefixed with `File `. Add an
    `--always-show-command-line` option to disable this behavior and always show
    the full command. (#2120, fixes #1733, @rgrinberg)

  - In `dune-workspace` files, add the ability to choose the host context and to
    create duplicates of the default context with different settings. (#2098,
    @TheLortex, review by @jeremiedimino, @rgrinberg and @aalekseyev)

  - Add support for hg in `dune subst` (#2135, @jeremiedimino)

  - Don't build documentation for implementations of virtual libraries (#2141,
    fixes #2138, @jonludlam)

  - Fix generation of the `-pp` flag in .merlin (#2142, @rgrinberg)

  - Make `dune subst` add a `(version ...)` field to the `dune-project`
    file (#2148, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add the `%{os_type}` variable, which is a short-hand for
    `%{ocaml-config:os_type}` (#1764, @jeremiedimino)

  - Allow `enabled_if` fields in `library` stanzas, restricted to the
    `%{os_type}`, `%{model}`, `%{architecture}`, `%{system}` variables (#1764,
    #2164 @jeremiedimino, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix `chdir` on external and source paths. Dune will also fail gracefully if
    the external or source path does not exist (#2165, fixes #2158, @rgrinberg)

  - Support the `.cc` extension fro C++ sources (#2195, fixes #83, @rgrinberg)

  - Run `ocamlformat` relative to the context root. This improves the locations of
    errors. (#2196, fixes #1370, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix detection of `README`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGE`, and `HISTORY` files. These
    would be undetected whenever the project was nested in another workspace.
    (#2194, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix generation of `.merlin` whenever there's more than one stanza with the
    same ppx preprocessing specification (#2209 ,fixes #2206, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix generation of `.merlin` in the presence of the `copy_files` stanza and
    preprocessing specifications of other stanazs. (#2211, fixes #2206,
    @rgrinberg)

  - Run `refmt` from the context's root directory. This improves error messages in
    case of syntax errors. (#2223, @rgrinberg)

  - In .merlin files, don't pass `-dump-ast` to the `future_syntax` preprocessor.
    Merlin doesn't seem to like it when binary AST is generated by a `-pp`
    preprocessor. (#2236, @aalekseyev)

  - `dune install` will verify that all files mentioned in all .install files
    exist before trying to install anything. This prevents partial installation of
    packages (#2230, @rgrinberg)

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the 1.10.0 release of dune. This release is packed with bug fixes, but it also introduces a few interesting features. I'll highlight one important feature that we've introduced and plan to improve in future versions:

Dune allows you to specify package metadata in the dune project file and generate an appropriate opam file. This is advantageous to writing opam files manually as dune will correctly fill in some boilerplate such as the build command:

Here's a snippet from dune's own project file as a demonstration:

```
(generate_opam_files true) ;; necessary to enbale the generation

(license MIT)
(maintainers "Jane Street Group, LLC <opensource@janestreet.com>")
(authors "Jane Street Group, LLC <opensource@janestreet.com>")
(source (github ocaml/dune))
(documentation "https://dune.readthedocs.io/")

(package
 (name dune)
 (depends
  (ocaml (>= 4.02))
  base-unix
  base-threads)
 (conflicts
  (jbuilder (<> "transition"))
  (odoc (< 1.3.0))
  (dune-release (< 1.3.0)))
 (synopsis "Fast, portable and opinionated build system")
 (description "<redacted>"))
```

Generating the opam file is done via `$ dune build @check` (the `@install`, and `@all` aliases will also work).

Later, we plan to have dune do some sanity checks on the `depends` field. In the more distant future, we might even skip the generation step altogether by having opam invoke dune to get the generated opam file directly.
