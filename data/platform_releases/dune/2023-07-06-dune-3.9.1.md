  ## Fixes

  - Initialize async I/O thread lazily. (#8122, @emillon)

In Dune 3.9.0, we added a feature that offloads some computations to background
threads. Unfortunately, this has a bad interaction on macOS, where we fork
processes to implement the RPC server and watch mode.

We marked Dune 3.9.0 unavailable on macOS, and released 3.9.1 with some
mitigations: we don't offload these computations on macOS, and we only fork
when necessary.

The plan for the next release is to stop forking processes on macOS.
