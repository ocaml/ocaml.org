title: Dune 3.12.1
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  ## Added
  
  - Introduce `$ dune ocaml doc` to open and browse documentation. (#7262, fixes
    #6831, @EmileTrotignon)
  
  - `dune cache trim` now accepts binary byte units: `KiB`, `MiB`, etc. (#8618,
    @Alizter)
  
  - Introduce the `runtest_alias` field to the `cram` stanza. This allows
    removing default `runtest` alias from tests. (@rgrinberg, #8887)
  
  - Display cache location in Dune log (#8974, @nojb)
  
  - Dune can now be built and installed on Haiku (#8795, fix #8551, @Alizter)
  
  - Mark installed directories in `dune-package` files. This fixes `(package)`
    dependencies against packages that contain such directories. (#8953, fixes
    #8915, @emillon)

  - Introduce new experimental odoc rules (#8803, @jonjudlam)
  
  ## Changed
  
  - dune-build-info: when `version=""` is found in a `META` file, we now return
    `None` as a version string (#9177, @emillon)

  - No longer force colors for OCaml 4.03 and 4.04 (#8778, @rgrinberg)
  
  - Dependencies in the copying sandbox are now writeable (#8920, @rgrinberg)
  
  - Rules that only use internal dune actions (`write-file`, `echo`, etc.) can
    now be sandboxed. (#9041, fixes #8854, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `test_` prefix to default test name in `dune init project` (#9257,
    fixes #9131, @9sako6)
  
  ## Fixed
  
  - Do not ignore libraries named `bigarray` when they are defined in conjunction
    with OCaml 5.0 (#8902, fixes #8901, @rgrinberg)
  
  - Correctly ignore `bigarray` on recent versions of OCaml (#9076, @rgrinberg)
  
  - Absent packages shouldn't prevent all rules from being loaded (#8948, fixes
    #8630, @rgrinberg)
  
  - Correctly determine the stanza of menhir modules when `(include_subdirs
    qualified)` is enabled (@rgrinberg, #8949, fixes #7610)
  
  - Re-run actions whenever `(expand_aliases_in_sandbox)` changes (#8990,
    @rgrinberg)
  
  - Do not re-run rules when their location changes (#9052, @rgrinberg)
  
  - [coq rules] Be more tolerant when coqc --print-version / --config don't work
    properly, and fallback to a reasonable default. This fixes problems when
    building Coq projects with `(stdlib no)` and likely other cases. (#8966, fix
    #8958, @Alizter, reported by Lasse Blaauwbroek)
  
  - Dune will now run at a lower framerate of 15 fps rather than 60 when
    `INSIDE_EMACS`. (#8812, @Alizter)

We're pleased to announce the release of Dune 3.12!

Note that due to a mistake during the release process, version `3.12.0` was not
published to opam and should not be used.

This version contains many fixes but we would like to highlight the following
features:

- `dune ocaml doc` is a new command that will build the docs of your package,
  and open them in a web browser directly.
- a new set of odoc rules will build documentation for the whole switch. It can
  be invoked by `dune build @doc-new`. Note that this is still experimental.
- Dune can now be built and installed on Haiku.
