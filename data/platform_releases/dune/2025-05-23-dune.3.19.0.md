    - Fixed a bug that was causing cram tests attached to multiple aliases to be run multiple
      times. (#11547, @Alizter)

      `foreign_library` (#11707, @Alizter, @rgrinberg)

      unqualified)` (#11729, fixes #10999, @rgrinberg)

    - Fix `$ dune subst` in sub directories of a git repository (#11760, fixes
      #11045, @Richard-Degenne)

    - Fix a crash involving `Path.drop_prefix` when using Melange on Windows
      (#11767, @nojb)

    ### Added

    - Added detection and warning for common typos in package dependency
      constraints (#11600, fixes #11575, @kemsguy7)

    - Added `(extra_objects)` field to `(foreign_library)` stanza with `(:include)` support.
      (#11683, @Alizter)

    ### Changed

    - Allow build RPC messages to be handled by dune's RPC server in eager watch
      mode (#11622, @gridbugs)
