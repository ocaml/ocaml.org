title: Dune 3.14.0
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
   ### Added
   
   - Introduce a `(dynamic_include ..)` stanza. This is like `(include foo)` but
     allows `foo` to be the target of a rule. Currently, there are some
     limitations on the stanzas that can be generated. For example, public
     executables, libraries are currently forbidden. (#9913, @rgrinberg)
   
   - Introduce `$ dune promotion list` to print the list of available promotions.
     (#9705, @moyodiallo)
   
   - If Sherlodoc is installed, add a search bar in generated HTML docs (#9772,
     @EmileTrotignon)
   
   - Add `only_sources` field to `copy_files` stanza (#9827, fixes #9709,
     @jchavarri)
   
   - The `(foreign_library)` stanza now supports the `(enabled_if)` field. (#9914,
     @nojb)
   
   ### Fixed
   
   - Fix `$ dune install -p` incorrectly recognizing packages that are supposed to
     be filtered (#9879, fixes #4814, @rgrinberg)
   
   - subst: correctly handle opam files in opam/ subdirectory (#9895, fixes #9862,
     @emillon)
   
   - Odoc private rules are not set up if a library is not available due to
     `enabled_if` (#9897, @rgrinberg and @jchavarri)
   
   ### Changed
   
   - When dune language 3.14 is enabled, resolve the binary in `(run %{bin:..}
     ..)` from where the binary is built. (#9708, @rgrinberg)
   
   - boot: remove single-command bootstrap. This was an alternative bootstrap
     strategy that was used in certain conditions. Removal makes the bootstrap a
     bit slower on Linux when only a single core is available, but bootstrap is
     now reproducible in all cases. (#9735, fixes #9507, @emillon)

We're happy to announce that Dune 3.14.0 is now available.
This feature has many fixes and new features that you can find in the changelog.

There are a few new features that we would like to specially highlight.

### Dynamic dune files with `(dynamic_include)`

It is common for some parts of a build to be dynamic: for example a source file
can be generated, or some parts of the configuration like C flags can be
generated from a Dune rule. But until now it was not possible to generate rules
dynamically.

For example, one might want to do it is to set up one rule per input file. This
is a common pattern in test suites and is easy to do with Make. But Dune does
not have a concept of parameterized rules, so it is necessary to set up one
rule per input file.

The pattern to do this with Dune is to:

- Write a generator that lists the input files and emits Dune stanzas (as text);
- Add a rule that makes a `dune.inc` file using this generator;
- Add `(include dune.inc)` in the main `dune` file,

However, this requires checking in the generated `dune.inc` file in the
repository. Another drawback is that when modifying the list of input files, it
is necessary to run tests twice: one to update `dune.inc`, one to run the new
test.

This release of Dune adds a new `(dynamic_include)` stanza that lifts these
restrictions: `dune.inc` does not have to be part of the source tree, it can be
generated transparently. This comes with some restrictions: some stanzas can
not be generated, in particular the ones that define public libraries. And due
to how rule loading works, the generated stanza needs to be defined in a
different directory.

Still, this should be useful for many users that rely on the
generate-include-commit pattern described above.

### Sherlodoc integration

Sherlodoc is a search engine for OCaml documentation, which supports search by
name, documentation and fuzzy type search (similar to Hoogle in the Haskell
world). It can be obtained from opam using `opam install sherlodoc`.

When it is available, Dune commands that produce HTML documentation, such as
`dune build @doc` and `dune build @doc-new`, will include a search bar in the
generated output.
