title: Dune 1.5.0
tags: [dune, platform]
changelog: |
  - Filter out empty paths from `OCAMLPATH` and `PATH` (#1436, @rgrinberg)

  - Do not add the `lib.cma.js` target in lib's directory. Put this target in a
    sub directory instead. (#1435, fix #1302, @rgrinberg)

  - Install generated OCaml files with a `.ml` rather than a `.ml-gen` extension
    (#1425, fix #1414, @rgrinberg)

  - Allow to use the `bigarray` library in >= 4.07 without ocamlfind and without
    installing the corresponding `otherlib`. (#1455, @nojb)

  - Add `@all` alias to build all targets defined in a directory (#1409, fix
    #1220, @rgrinberg)

  - Add `@check` alias to build all targets required for type checking and tooling
    support. (#1447, fix #1220, @rgrinberg)

  - Produce the odoc index page with the content wrapper to make it consistent
    with odoc's theming (#1469, @rizo)

  - Unblock signals in processes started by dune (#1461, fixes #1451,
    @jeremiedimino)

  - Respect `OCAMLFIND_TOOLCHAIN` and add a `toolchain` option to contexts in the
    workspace file. (#1449, fix #1413, @rgrinberg)

  - Fix error message when using `copy_files` stanza to copy files from
    a non sub directory with lang set to dune < 1.3 (#1486, fixes #1485,
    @NathanReb)

  - Install man pages in the correct subdirectory (#1483, fixes #1441, @emillon)

  - Fix version syntax check for `test` stanza's `action` field. Only
    emits a warning for retro-compatibility (#1474, fixes #1471,
    @NathanReb)

  - Fix interpretation of paths in `env` stanzas (#1509, fixes #1508, @jeremiedimino)

  - Add `context_name` expansion variable (#1507, @rgrinberg)

  - Use shorter paths for generated on-demand ppx drivers. This is to
    help Windows builds where paths are limited in length (#1511, fixes
    #1497, @jeremiedimino)

  - Fix interpretation of environment variables under `setenv`. Also forbid
    dynamic environment names or values (#1503, @rgrinberg).

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the 1.5.0 release of dune. This release does not contain any major features, but it does contain a few notable bug fixes and a couple of useful little additions. First of all, `$ dune exec` now supports `C-c` again - I know this affected many of you. This releases introduces a couple of new aliases that will hopefully find their way into your workflows.

The first alias is `@all` and has been much requested by our users. `$ dune build @dir/all` will build all user defined targets in a the directory `dir`. This would include binaries, libraries, and user defined targets in `dir`. This alias should have been the defaulted instead of `@install` when running `$ dune build`, but we'll have to wait until dune 2.0 to make this compatibility breaking change. In the mean time, I highly recommend everyone to use `$ dune build @all` instead of `$ dune build` meanwhile. You may also set the default alias per project as well:

```
(alias
 (name default)
 (deps (alias_rec all)))
```

The second new alias is `@check`. It is inspired by cargo's `check` subcommand and roughly corresponds to type checking the project and building all artifacts necessary for editor integration - cmt, cmti's, .merlin, etc. This is the fastest target to verify that a project is in a valid state. Note that this alias will not relink binaries so it might not catch errors such as missing stubs. I find this alias handy when doing large, type driven refactoring of a codebase.

The rest of the change log is replicated below. Happy hacking!
