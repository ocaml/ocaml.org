Creating a library with dune is as simple as adding a `library` stanza in your dune file:

```dune
(library
 (name <name>)
 (public_name <public_name>)
 (libraries <libraries...>))
```

Where `<name>` is the name of the library used inside internally, `<public_name>` is the name of the library used by users of the package and `<libaries...>` is the list of libraries to link to your library.

Note that if the library does not have a `public_name`, it will not be installed when installing the package through opam. As a consequence, you cannot use an internal library that does not have a `public_name` in a library or executable that has one.
