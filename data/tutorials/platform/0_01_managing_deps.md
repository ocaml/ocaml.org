  How to manage dependencies with opam

## Installing Existing Dependencies

We recommend installing a project's dependencies in a local opam switch to sandbox your development environment.

If you're using opam `2.0.X`, you can do this with:

```
# if you need external system dependencies
opam pin add -n .
opam depext -i <packages>
opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc
```

If you use opam `2.1.X`, it will install the system dependencies automatically, so you can run:

```
opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc
```

Now, if for some reason you prefer to install your dependencies in a global switch, you can run:

```
opam switch set <switch_name>
opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc
```

Once the dependencies have been installed successfully, and assuming the project uses Dune as the build system, you can compile it with:

```
opam exec -- dune build
```

Or if you set your environment with `eval $(opam env)`:

```
dune build
```

## Adding Dependencies From the opam Repository

To avoid duplicating the project configuration into multiple files, Dune allows you to generate the project's `*.opam` file from the 
package definitions in `dune-project` when adding the `(generate_opam_files true)` stanza.

However, opam remains a central piece of the ecosystem, and it's very likely that you will have to work with `*.opam` files at some point,
so we don't take a stance on whether you should specify your dependencies in the `*.opam` file or in `dune-project`.

### Adding a Dependency to Your dune-project File

If the project generates the opam file from the `dune-project` (you can tell by the line `# This file is generated by dune, edit dune-project instead` at the top of the `*.opam` file), you can add your dependencies in the `dune-project` in the appropriate `package` stanza. It should look like this:

```dune
(package
 (name demo)
 (synopsis "A short, but powerful statement about your project")
 (description "An complete and exhaustive description everything your project does.")
 (depends
  (ocaml
   (>= 4.08.0))
  dune
  (alcotest :with-test)
  (odoc :with-doc)))
```

Once you have added your dependency, you can build your project with `dune build` which will regenerate the `*.opam` files.

### Adding a Dependency to Your .opam File

If the `*.opam` files are not generated, you can add the dependencies in them directly in the `depends` field. It should look like this:


```opam
opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "A short, but powerful statement about your project"
description: "An complete and exhaustive description everything your project does."
depends: [
  "ocaml" {>= "4.08.0"}
  "dune"
  "alcotest" {with-test}
  "odoc" {with-doc}
]
build: [
  ["dune" "subst"] {pinned}
  [
    "dune"
    "build"
    "-p"
    name
    "-j"
    jobs
    "@install"
    "@runtest" {with-test}
    "@doc" {with-doc}
  ]
]
```

Either way, once you have added your dependency in the appropriate file, you can run `opam install . --deps-only` to update your current switch dependencies.

### Installing a Dependency in Your Switch

Installing a package from the opam repository to your active switch, you can run
```
opam install <package-name>
```

to get the latest version of the package.

If you want to install a specific version of the package, use
```
opam install <package-name>.<package-version>
```

instead.

## Adding Dependencies From a Git Repository

Sometimes, you may want to install a package directly from a Git repository, e.g., when it is not available on the opam repository or when you want to use an unreleased version.

### Adding a Git Dependency to a dune-project File

In OCaml projects that use Dune for building and opam for package management, you can specify Git dependencies using a combination of `dune-project` and `.opam.template` files.

This approach is particularly useful when you want to keep the Dune and opam configurations in sync, especially when dealing with external dependencies from Git repositories.

If your project does not have a file matching the name of your project's `.opam` file, but with the file extension `.opam.template`, you have to create it.

For example, if your project's opam file is `my_project.opam`, create `my_project.opam.template` and use `pin-depends` to tell `opam` to install a package from a Git repository.

```
pin-depends: [
  ["<package-name>.dev" "git+https://<repository-url>#<branch-or-commit>"]
]
```

Next, regenerate the `.opam` file of your project by running
```
opam exec -- dune build
```

Then, run
```
opam install . --deps-only
```

to install the new dependency you added.

### Adding a Git Dependency to Your .opam File

To open your opam file, locate the `opam` file for your OCaml project. This file defines the package's dependencies and other metadata.

Add the `pin-depends` field in the `opam` file if it doesn't exist. Inside this field, you specify the package and the URL from which it should be fetched. For example:

```
pin-depends: [
  ["<package-name>.dev" "git+https://<repository-url>#<branch-or-commit>"]
]
```

Finally, use opam install to install the dependencies, including the one specified in the `pin-depends` field.

```
opam install . --deps-only
```

### Installing a Git Dependency in Your Switch

You can install a package in your active switch directly from a Git URL:

```
opam pin add <package-name> <git-url>#<branch-or-commit>
```

## Dealing With Development-Only Dependencies

Opam does not have a notion of development dependencies. Instead, each dependency can be either:

- A normal dependency (used at runtime)
- A build dependency (used to build the project)
- A test dependency (used to test the project)
- A documentation dependency (used to generate the documentation)

When adding a new dependency, as seen in the "Update Dependencies" workflow, you can add a flag to your dependency.

For `dune-project`, it looks like this:

```dune
(alcotest :with-test)
```

And for the `*.opam` file, it looks like:

```opam
"alcotest" {with-test}
```

The available flags for each dependencies are:

- Normal: no flag
- Build: `build`
- Test: `with-test`
- Documentation: `with-doc`

See [opam documentation](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Manual.html#Package-variables) for more details on the opam syntax.
