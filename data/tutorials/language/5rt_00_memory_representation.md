This is an adaptation of the chapter [Memory Representation of Values](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/runtime-memory-layout.html) from the book [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/), reproduced here with permission.

This document covers the precise mapping from OCaml types to runtime values
and walks you through them via the toplevel. The internal runtime representation of OCaml
values in memory is relevant

* when you want to interface with
code written in other programming languages, e.g. C, Rust, and others,
* when using various external system tools that operate on OCaml binaries,
such as profiling tools and debuggers

The OCaml toolchain is very predictable. The compiler minimizes the
amount of optimization magic that it performs, and relies instead on its
straightforward execution model for good performance. With some experience,
you can know rather precisely where a block of performance-critical OCaml
code is spending its time.

At the end of this document, you will be able to translate between OCaml
values and their memory representation.

## OCaml Types Disappear at Runtime

The OCaml compiler runs through several phases during the compilation
process. The first phase is syntax checking, during which source files are
parsed into abstract syntax trees (ASTs). The next stage is a *type checking*
pass over the AST. In a validly typed program, a function cannot be applied
with an unexpected type. For example, the `print_endline` function must
receive a single `string` argument, and an `int` will result in a type error.

Since OCaml verifies these properties at compile time, it doesn't need to
keep track of as much information at runtime. Thus, later stages of the
compiler can discard and simplify the type declarations to a much more
minimal subset that's actually required to distinguish polymorphic values at
runtime. This is a major performance win versus something like a Java or .NET
method call, where the runtime must look up the concrete instance of the
object and dispatch the method call. Those languages amortize some of the
cost via "Just-in-Time" dynamic patching, but OCaml prefers runtime
simplicity instead.

We'll explain this compilation pipeline in more detail in
[The Compiler Frontend: Parsing And Type Checking](/docs/compiler-frontend)
and
[The Compiler Backend: Byte Code And Native Code](/docs/compiler-backend).

We'll cover how these values are
managed by the runtime later on in
[Understanding The Garbage Collector](/docs/garbage-collector).

## OCaml Blocks and Values

A running OCaml program uses blocks of memory (i.e., contiguous sequences of
words in RAM) to represent values such as tuples, records, closures, or
arrays. An OCaml program implicitly allocates a block of memory when such a
value is created:

```ocaml env=simple_record
# type t = { foo: int; bar: int };;
type t = { foo : int; bar : int; }
# let x = { foo = 13; bar = 14 };;
val x : t = {foo = 13; bar = 14}
```

The type declaration `t` doesn't take up any memory at runtime, but the
subsequent `let` binding allocates a new block of memory with two words of
available space. One word holds the `foo` field, and the other word holds the
`bar` field. The OCaml compiler translates such an expression into an
explicit allocation for the block from OCaml's runtime system.

OCaml uses a uniform memory representation in which every OCaml variable is
stored as a *value*. An OCaml value is a single memory word that is either an
immediate integer or a pointer to some other memory. The OCaml runtime tracks
all values so that it can free them when they are no longer needed. It thus
needs to be able to distinguish between integer and pointer values, since it
scans pointers to find further values but doesn't follow integers that don't
point to anything meaningful beyond their immediate value.

### Distinguishing Integers and Pointers at Runtime <a name="distinguishing-integer-and-pointers-at-runtime"></a>

Wrapping primitive types (such as integers) inside another data
structure that records extra metadata about the value is known as
*boxing*. Values are boxed in order to make it easier for the garbage
collector (GC) to do its job, but at the expense of an extra level of
indirection to access the data within the boxed value.

OCaml values don't all have to be boxed at runtime. Instead, values
use a single tag bit per word to distinguish integers and pointers at
runtime. The value is an integer if the lowest bit of the block word
is nonzero, and a pointer if the lowest bit of the block word is
zero. Several OCaml types map onto this integer representation,
including `bool`, `int`, the empty list, and `unit`.  Some types, like
variants, sometimes use this integer representation and sometimes
don't.  In particular, for variants, constant constructors, i.e.,
constructors with no arguments like `None`, are represented as
integers, but constructors like `Some` that carry associated values
are boxed.

This representation means that integers are unboxed runtime values in OCaml
so that they can be stored directly without having to allocate a wrapper
block. They can be passed directly to other function calls in registers and
are generally the cheapest and fastest values to use in OCaml.

A value is treated as a memory pointer if its lowest bit is zero. A pointer
value can still be stored unmodified despite this, since pointers are
guaranteed to be word-aligned (with the bottom bits always being zero).

The only problem that remains with this memory representation is
distinguishing between pointers to OCaml values (which should be followed by
the GC) and pointers into the system heap to C values (which shouldn't be
followed).

The mechanism for this is simple, since the runtime system keeps track of the
heap blocks it has allocated for OCaml values. If the pointer is inside a
heap chunk that is marked as being managed by the OCaml runtime, it is
assumed to point to an OCaml value. If it points outside the OCaml runtime
area, it is treated as an opaque C pointer to some other system resource.

#### Some History About OCaml's Word-Aligned Pointers

The alert reader may be wondering how OCaml can guarantee that all of its
pointers are word-aligned. In the old days, when RISC chips such as Sparc,
MIPS, and Alpha were commonplace, unaligned memory accesses were forbidden by
the instruction set architecture and would result in a CPU exception that
terminated the program. Thus, all pointers were historically rounded off to
the architecture word size (usually 32 or 64 bits).

Modern CISC processors such as the Intel x86 do support unaligned memory
accesses, but the chip still runs faster if accesses are word-aligned. OCaml
therefore simply mandates that all pointers be word-aligned, which guarantees
that the bottom few bits of any valid pointer will be zero. Setting the
bottom bit to a nonzero value is a simple way to mark an integer, at the cost
of losing that single bit of precision.

An even more alert reader will be wondering about the performance
implications are for integer arithmetic using this tagged representation.
Since the bottom bit is set, any operation on the integer has to shift the
bottom bit right to recover the "native" value. The native code OCaml
compiler generates efficient x86 assembly code in this case, taking advantage
of modern processor instructions to hide the extra shifts where possible.
Addition is a single `LEA` x86 instruction, subtraction can be two
instructions, and multiplication is only a few more.


## Blocks and Values

An OCaml *block* is the basic unit of allocation on the heap. A block
consists of a one-word header (either 32 or 64 bits depending on the CPU
architecture) followed by variable-length data that is either opaque bytes or
an array of *fields*. The header has a multipurpose tag byte that defines
whether to interpret the subsequent data as opaque bytes or OCaml fields.

The GC never inspects opaque bytes. If the tag indicates an array of OCaml
fields are present, their contents are all treated as more valid OCaml
values. The GC always inspects fields and follows them as part of the
collection process described earlier.

 ![Memory representation of a block](/media/tutorials/language/runtime-memory-layout/block.png "Memory representation of a block")

The `size` field records the length of the block in memory words. This is 22
bits on 32-bit platforms, which is the reason OCaml strings are limited to 16
MB on that architecture. If you need bigger strings, either switch to a
64-bit host, or use the [`Bigarray`](/manual/api/Bigarray.html) module.

The 2-bit `color` field is used by the GC to keep track of its state during
mark-and-sweep collection.
We'll come back to this field in
[Understanding The Garbage Collector](/docs/garbage-collector).
This tag isn't exposed to OCaml source code in any case.

A block's tag byte is multipurpose, and indicates whether the data array
represents opaque bytes or fields. If a block's tag is greater than or equal
to `No_scan_tag` (251), then the block's data are all opaque bytes, and are
not scanned by the collector. The most common such block is the `string`
type, which we describe in more detail later in this chapter.

The exact representation of values inside a block depends on their static
OCaml type. All OCaml types are distilled down into `values`, and summarized below.

- `int` or `char` are stored directly as a value, shifted left by 1
  bit, with the least significant bit set to 1.

- `unit`, `[]`, `false` are all stored as OCaml `int` 0.

- `true` is stored as OCaml `int` 1.

- `Foo | Bar` variants are stored as ascending OCaml `int`s, starting
  from 0.

- `Foo | Bar of int` variants with parameters are boxed, while
  variants with no parameters are unboxed.

- Polymorphic variants with parameters are boxed with an extra
  header word to store the value, as compared to normal variants.
  Polymorphic variants with no parameters are unboxed.

- Floating-point numbers are stored as a block with a single field
  containing the double-precision float.

- Strings are word-aligned byte arrays with an explicit length.

- `[1; 2; 3]` lists are stored as `1::2::3::[]` where `[]` is an int,
  and `h::t` a block with tag 0 and two parameters.

- Tuples, records, and arrays are stored as a C array of
  values. Arrays can be variable size, but tuples and records are
  fixed-size.

- Records or arrays that are all float use a special tag for unboxed
  arrays of floats, or records that only have `float` fields.

### Integers, Characters, and Other Basic Types

Many basic types are efficiently stored as unboxed integers at runtime. The
native `int` type is the most obvious, although it drops a single bit of
precision due to the tag bit. Other atomic types such as `unit` and the empty
list `[]` value are stored as constant integers. Boolean values have a value
of `1` and `0` for `true` and `false`, respectively.

These basic types such as empty lists and `unit` are very efficient to use,
since integers are never allocated on the heap. They can be passed directly
in registers and not appear on the stack if you don't have too many
parameters to your functions. Modern architectures such as `x86_64` have a
lot of spare registers to further improve the efficiency of using unboxed
integers.


## Tuples, Records, and Arrays

![](/media/tutorials/language/runtime-memory-layout/tuple_layout.png "Tuple Layout")


Tuples, records, and arrays are all represented identically at runtime as a
block with tag `0`. Tuples and records have constant sizes determined at
compile time, whereas arrays can be of variable length. While arrays are
restricted to containing a single type of element in the OCaml type system,
this is not required by the memory representation.

You can check the difference between a block and a direct integer yourself
using the `Obj` module, which exposes the internal representation of values
to OCaml code:

```ocaml env=reprs
# Obj.is_block (Obj.repr (1,2,3));;
- : bool = true
# Obj.is_block (Obj.repr 1);;
- : bool = false
```

The `Obj.repr` function retrieves the runtime representation of any OCaml
value. `Obj.is_block` checks the bottom bit to determine if the value is a
block header or an unboxed integer.

### Floating-Point Numbers and Arrays

Floating-point numbers in OCaml are always stored as full, double-precision
values. Individual floating-point values are stored as a block with a single
field that contains the number. This block has the `Double_tag` set, which
signals to the collector that the floating-point value is not to be scanned:

```ocaml env=reprs
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr 1.0);;
- : int = 253
# Obj.double_tag;;
- : int = 253
```

Since each floating-point value is boxed in a separate memory block,
it can be inefficient to handle large arrays of floats in comparison
to unboxed integers. OCaml therefore special-cases records or arrays
that contain *only* `float` types. These are stored in a block that
contains the floats packed directly in the data section, with
`Double_array_tag` set to signal to the collector that the contents
are not OCaml values.


![](/media/tutorials/language/runtime-memory-layout/float_array_layout.png "Float array layout")

First, let's check that float arrays do in fact have a different tag number
from normal floating-point values:

```ocaml env=reprs
# Obj.double_tag;;
- : int = 253
# Obj.double_array_tag;;
- : int = 254
```

This tells us that float arrays have a tag value of 254. Now let's test some
sample values using the `Obj.tag` function to check that the allocated block
has the expected runtime tag, and also use `Obj.double_field` to retrieve a
float from within the block:

```ocaml env=reprs
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr [| 1.0; 2.0; 3.0 |]);;
- : int = 254
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) );;
- : int = 0
# Obj.double_field (Obj.repr [| 1.1; 2.2; 3.3 |]) 1;;
- : float = 2.2
# Obj.double_field (Obj.repr 1.234) 0;;
- : float = 1.234
```

The first thing we tested was that a float array has the correct unboxed
float array tag value (254). However, the next line tests a tuple of
floating-point values instead, which are *not* optimized in the same way and
have the normal tuple tag value (0).

Only records and arrays can have the float array optimization, and for
records, every single field must be a float.


## Variants and Lists

Basic variant types with no extra parameters for any of their branches are
simply stored as an OCaml integer, starting with `0` for the first option and
in ascending order:

```ocaml env=reprs
# type t = Apple | Orange | Pear;;
type t = Apple | Orange | Pear
# ((Obj.magic (Obj.repr Apple)) : int);;
- : int = 0
# ((Obj.magic (Obj.repr Pear)) : int);;
- : int = 2
# Obj.is_block (Obj.repr Apple);;
- : bool = false
```

`Obj.magic` unsafely forces a type cast between any two OCaml types; in this
example, the `int` type hint retrieves the runtime integer value. The
`Obj.is_block` confirms that the value isn't a more complex block, but just
an OCaml `int`.

Variants that have parameters are a little more complex. They are
stored as blocks, with the value *tags* ascending from 0 (counting from
leftmost variants with parameters). The parameters are stored as words in the
block:

```ocaml env=reprs
# type t = Apple | Orange of int | Pear of string | Kiwi;;
type t = Apple | Orange of int | Pear of string | Kiwi
# Obj.is_block (Obj.repr (Orange 1234));;
- : bool = true
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr (Orange 1234));;
- : int = 0
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr (Pear "xyz"));;
- : int = 1
# (Obj.magic (Obj.field (Obj.repr (Orange 1234)) 0) : int);;
- : int = 1234
# (Obj.magic (Obj.field (Obj.repr (Pear "xyz")) 0) : string);;
- : string = "xyz"
```

In the preceding example, the `Apple` and `Kiwi` values are still stored as
normal OCaml integers with values `0` and `1`, respectively. The `Orange` and
`Pear` values both have parameters and are stored as blocks whose tags ascend
from `0` (and so `Pear` has a tag of `1`, as the use of `Obj.tag` verifies).
Finally, the parameters are fields that contain OCaml values within the
block, and `Obj.field` can be used to retrieve them.

Lists are stored with a representation that is exactly the same as if the
list was written as a variant type with `Nil` and `Cons`. The empty list
`[]` is an integer `0`, and subsequent blocks have tag `0` and two
parameters: a block with the current value, and a pointer to the rest of the
list.

### Obj Module Considered Harmful

`Obj` is an undocumented module that exposes the internals of the OCaml
compiler and runtime. It is very useful for examining and understanding how
your code will behave at runtime but should *never* be used for production
code unless you understand the implications. The module bypasses the OCaml
type system, making memory corruption and segmentation faults possible.

Some theorem provers such as Coq do output code that uses `Obj` internally,
but the external module signatures never expose it. Unless you too have a
machine proof of correctness to accompany your use of `Obj`, stay away from
it except for debugging!

Due to this encoding, there is a limit around 240 variants with parameters
that applies to each type definition, but the only limit on the number of
variants without parameters is the size of the native integer (either 31 or
63 bits). This limit arises because of the size of the tag byte, and that
some of the high-numbered tags are reserved.

## Polymorphic Variants <a name="polymorphic-variants-1"></a>

<!-- FIXME: reference polymorphic variants tutorial from OCaml.org -->
Polymorphic variants are more flexible than normal variants when writing code
but are slightly less efficient at runtime. This is because there isn't as
much static compile-time information available to optimize their memory
layout.

A polymorphic variant without any parameters is stored as an unboxed integer
and so only takes up one word of memory, just like a normal variant. This
integer value is determined by applying a hash function to the *name* of the
variant. The hash function is exposed via the `compiler-libs` package that
reveals some of the internals of the OCaml compiler:

```ocaml env=reprs
# #require "ocaml-compiler-libs.common";;
# Btype.hash_variant "Foo";;
- : int = 3505894
# (Obj.magic (Obj.repr `Foo) : int);;
- : int = 3505894
```

The hash function is designed to give the same results on 32-bit and 64-bit
architectures, so the memory representation is stable across different CPUs
and host types.

Polymorphic variants use more memory space than normal variants when
parameters are included in the data type constructors. Normal variants use
the tag byte to encode the variant value and save the fields for the
contents, but this single byte is insufficient to encode the hashed value for
polymorphic variants. They must allocate a new block (with tag `0`) and store
the value in there instead. Polymorphic variants with constructors thus use
one word of memory more than normal variant constructors.

Another inefficiency over normal variants is when a polymorphic variant
constructor has more than one parameter. Normal variants hold parameters as a
single flat block with multiple fields for each entry, but polymorphic
variants must adopt a more flexible uniform memory representation, since they
may be reused in a different context across compilation units. They allocate
a tuple block for the parameters that is pointed to from the argument field
of the variant. There are thus three additional words for such variants,
along with an extra memory indirection due to the tuple.

The extra space usage is generally not significant in a typical application,
and polymorphic variants offer a great deal more flexibility than normal
variants. However, if you're writing code that demands high performance or
must run within tight memory bounds, the runtime layout is at least very
predictable. The OCaml compiler never switches memory representation due to
optimization passes. This lets you predict the precise runtime layout by
referring to these guidelines and your source code.

## String Values

OCaml `string`s (and their mutable cousins, `bytes`) are standard
OCaml blocks with the header size defining the size of the string in
machine words. The `String_tag` (252) is higher than the
`No_scan_tag`, indicating that the contents of the block are opaque to
the collector. The block contents are the contents of the string, with
padding bytes to align the block on a word boundary.

![](/media/tutorials/language/runtime-memory-layout/string_block.png "String block layout")

On a 32-bit machine, the padding is calculated based on the modulo of the
string length and word size to ensure the result is word-aligned. A 64-bit
machine extends the potential padding up to 7 bytes instead of 3.
Given a string length modulo 4:

- `0` has padding `00 00 00 03`
- `1` has padding `00 00 02`
- `2` has padding `00 01`
- `3` has padding `00`

This string representation is a clever way to ensure that the contents
are always zero-terminated by the padding word and to still compute
its length efficiently without scanning the whole string. The
following formula is used:

```
number_of_words_in_block * sizeof(word) - last_byte_of_block - 1
```

The guaranteed `NULL` termination comes in handy when passing a string to C,
but is not relied upon to compute the length from OCaml code. OCaml strings
can thus contain `NULL` bytes at any point within the string.

Care should be taken that any C library functions that receive these buffers
can also cope with arbitrary bytes within the buffer contents and are not
expecting C strings. For instance, the C `memcopy` or `memmove` standard
library functions can operate on arbitrary data, but `strlen` or `strcpy`
both require a `NULL`-terminated buffer, and neither has a mechanism for
encoding a `NULL` value within its contents.

## Custom Heap Blocks

OCaml supports *custom* heap blocks via a `Custom_tag` that lets the runtime
perform user-defined operations over OCaml values. A custom block lives in
the OCaml heap like an ordinary block and can be of whatever size the user
desires. The `Custom_tag` (255) is higher than `No_scan_tag` and so isn't
scanned by the GC.

The first word of the data within the custom block is a C pointer to a
`struct` of custom operations. The custom block cannot have pointers to OCaml
blocks and is opaque to the GC:

```
struct custom_operations {
  char *identifier;
  void (*finalize)(value v);
  int (*compare)(value v1, value v2);
  intnat (*hash)(value v);
  void (*serialize)(value v,
                    /*out*/ uintnat * wsize_32 /*size in bytes*/,
                    /*out*/ uintnat * wsize_64 /*size in bytes*/);
  uintnat (*deserialize)(void * dst);
  int (*compare_ext)(value v1, value v2);
};
```

The custom operations specify how the runtime should perform polymorphic
comparison, hashing and binary marshaling. They also optionally contain a
*finalizer* that the runtime calls just before the block is
garbage-collected. This finalizer has nothing to do with ordinary OCaml
finalizers (as created by `Gc.finalize` and explained in
[Understanding The Garbage Collector](/docs/garbage-collector)).
They are instead used to call C cleanup functions such as `free`.

### Managing External Memory with Bigarray

A common use of custom blocks is to manage external system memory directly
from within OCaml. The Bigarray interface was originally intended to exchange
data with Fortran code, and maps a block of system memory as a
multidimensional array that can be accessed from OCaml. Bigarray operations
work directly on the external memory without requiring it to be copied into
the OCaml heap (which is a potentially expensive operation for large arrays).

Bigarray sees a lot of use beyond just scientific computing, and several Core
libraries use it for general-purpose I/O:

`Iobuf`
: The `Iobuf` module maps I/O buffers as a one-dimensional array of bytes. It
  provides a sliding window interface that lets consumer processes read from
  the buffer while it's being filled by producers. This lets OCaml use I/O
  buffers that have been externally allocated by the operating system without
  any extra data copying.

`Bigstring`
: The `Bigstring` module provides a `String`-like interface that uses
  [`Bigarray`](/manual/api/Bigarray.html) internally. The `Bigbuffer` collects these into extensible
  string buffers that can operate entirely on external system memory.

The [Lacaml](http://mmottl.github.io/lacaml/) library isn't part of Core but
provides the recommended interfaces to the widely used BLAS and LAPACK
mathematical Fortran libraries. These allow developers to write
high-performance numerical code for applications that require linear algebra.
It supports large vectors and matrices, but with static typing safety of
OCaml to make it easier to write safe algorithms.

## Conclusion

We covered the precise mapping from OCaml types to their internal runtime
representation in memory, which should enable you to better understand the
output of various debugging and profiling tools, as well as how to
integrate your OCaml code with code from other languages.
