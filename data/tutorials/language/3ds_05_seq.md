# Sequences

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with writing functions over lists and options.

## Introduction

Sequences are very much like lists. However from a pragmatic perspective, one
should imagine they may be infinite. That's the key intuition to understanding
and using sequences.

One way to look at a value of type `'a Seq.t` is to consider it as a list, with
a twist when it's not empty: a frozen tail. To understand this analogy,
consider how sequences are defined in the standard library:
```ocaml
type 'a node =
  | Nil
  | Cons of 'a * 'a t
and 'a t = unit -> 'a node
```
This is the mutually recursive definition of two types: `Seq.node`, which is
almost the same as `list`:
```ocaml
type 'a list =
  | []
  | (::) of 'a * 'a list
```
and `Seq.t`, which is merely a type alias for `unit -> 'a Seq.node`. The whole
point of this definition is `Seq.Cons` second component's type, which is a
function returning a sequence while its `list` counterpart is a list. Let's
compare the constructors of `list` and `Seq.node`:
1. Empty lists and sequences are defined the same way, a constructor without any
   parameters: `Seq.Nil` and `[]`.
1. Non-empty lists and sequences are both pairs whose former member is a piece
   of data.
1. However, the latter member in lists is recursively a `list`, while in
   sequences, it is a function returning a `Seq.node`.

A value of type `Seq.t` is “frozen” because the data it contains isn't
immediately available. A `unit` value has to be supplied to recover it, which we
may see as “unfreezing.” However, unfreezing only gives access to the tip of the
sequence, since the second argument of `Seq.Cons` is a function too.

Frozen-by-function tails explain why sequences may be considered potentially
infinite. Until a `Seq.Nil` value has been found in the sequence, one can't say
for sure if some will ever appear. The sequence could be a stream of incoming
requests in a server, readings from an embedded sensor, or system logs. All have
unforeseeable termination, and it is easier to consider them infinite.

In OCaml, any value `a` of type `t` can be turned into a constant function by
writing `fun _ -> a`, which has type `'a -> t`. When writing `fun () -> a`
instead, we get a function of type `unit -> t`. Such a function is called a
[_thunk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk). Using this terminology, `Seq.t`
values are thunks. With the analogy used earlier, `a` is frozen in its thunk.

Here is how to build seemingly infinite sequences of integers:
```ocaml
# let rec ints n : int Seq.t = fun () -> Seq.Cons (n, ints (n + 1));;
val ints : int -> int Seq.t = <fun>
```
The function `ints n` looks as if building the infinite sequence `(n; n + 1; n +
2; n + 3;...)`. In reality, since there isn't an infinite amount of distinct
values of type `int`, those sequences aren't indefinitely increasing. When
reaching `max_int`, the values will circle down to `min_int`. They are
ultimately periodic.

The OCaml standard library contains a module on sequences called
[`Seq`](/releases/5.0/api/Seq.html). It contains a `Seq.iter` function, which
has the same behaviour as `List.iter`. Writing this:
```ocaml
# Seq.iter print_int (ints 0);;
```
in an OCaml toplevel, this means “print integers forever,” and you have to press
`Ctrl-C` to interrupt the execution. Perhaps more interestingly, the following
code is also an infinite loop:
```ocaml
# Seq.iter ignore (ints 0);;
```
But the key point is: it doesn't leak memory.

## Example

The `Seq` module of the OCaml standard library contains the definition of the
function `Seq.take`, which returns a specified number of elements from the
beginning of a sequence. Here is a simplified implementation:
```ocaml
let rec take n seq () = match seq () with
  | Seq.Cons (x, seq) when n > 0 -> Seq.Cons (x, take (n - 1) seq)
  | _ -> Seq.Nil
```
`take n seq` returns, at most, the `n` first elements of the sequence `seq`. If
`seq` contains less than `n` elements, an identical sequence is returned. In
particular, if `seq` is empty, or `n` is negative, an empty sequence is returned.

Observe the first line of `take`. It is the common pattern for recursive
functions over sequences. The last two parameters are:
* a sequence called `seq`
* a `unit` value

When executed, the function begins by unfreezing `seq` (that is, calling `seq
()`) and then pattern matching to look inside the data made available. However, this
does not happen unless a `unit` parameter is passed to `take`. Writing `take 10
seq` does not compute anything. It is a partial application and returns a
function needing a `unit` to produce a result.

This can be used to print integers without looping forever, as shown previously:
```ocaml
# Seq.ints 0 |> Seq.take 43 |> List.of_seq;;
- : int list =
[0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21;
 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30; 31; 32; 33; 34; 35; 36; 37; 38; 39; 40;
 41; 42]
```

The `Seq` module also has a function `Seq.filter`:
```ocaml
# Seq.filter;;
- : ('a -> bool) -> 'a Seq.t -> 'a Seq.t = <fun>
```
It builds a sequence of elements satisfying a condition.

Using `Seq.filter`, it is possible to make a straightforward implementation of
the [Sieve of
Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). Here it is:
```ocaml
let rec sieve seq () = match seq () with
  | Seq.Cons (m, seq) -> Seq.Cons (m, sieve (Seq.filter (fun n -> n mod m > 0) seq))
  | seq -> seq
let primes = Seq.ints 2 |> sieve;;
val sieve : int Seq.t -> int Seq.t = <fun>
val primes : int Seq.t = <fun>
```

This code can be used to generate lists of prime numbers. For instance, here is
the list of 100 first prime numbers:
```ocaml
# primes |> Seq.take 100 |> List.of_seq;;
- : int list =
[2; 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 37; 41; 43; 47; 53; 59; 61; 67; 71;
 73; 79; 83; 89; 97; 101; 103; 107; 109; 113; 127; 131; 137; 139; 149; 151;
 157; 163; 167; 173; 179; 181; 191; 193; 197; 199; 211; 223; 227; 229; 233;
 239; 241; 251; 257; 263; 269; 271; 277; 281; 283; 293; 307; 311; 313; 317;
 331; 337; 347; 349; 353; 359; 367; 373; 379; 383; 389; 397; 401; 409; 419;
 421; 431; 433; 439; 443; 449; 457; 461; 463; 467; 479; 487; 491; 499; 503;
 509; 521; 523]
```

The function `sieve` is recursive in OCaml and common sense. It is defined using
the `rec` keyword and calls itself. However, some call that kind of function
[_corecursive_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corecursion). This word is used to
emphasise that, by design, it does not terminate. Strictly speaking, the sieve
of Eratosthenes is not an algorithm either since it does not terminate. This
implementation behaves the same.

## Unfolding Sequences

Standard higher-order iteration functions are available on sequences. For
instance:
* `Seq.iter`
* `Seq.map`
* `Seq.fold_left`

All those are also available for `Array`, `List`, and `Set` and behave
essentially the same. Observe that there is no `fold_right` function. Since
OCaml 4.11, there is something which isn't (yet) available on other types:
`unfold`. Here is how it is implemented:
```ocaml
let rec unfold f seq () = match f seq with
  | None -> Nil
  | Some (x, seq) -> Cons (x, unfold f seq)
```
And here is its type:
```ocaml
val unfold : ('a -> ('b * 'a) option) -> 'a -> 'b Seq.t = <fun>
```
Unlike previously mentioned iterators, `Seq.unfold` does not have a sequence
parameter, but a sequence result. `unfold` provides a general means to build
sequences. For instance, `Seq.ints` can be implemented using `Seq.unfold` in a
fairly compact way:
```ocaml
# let ints = Seq.unfold (fun n -> Some (n, n + 1));;
val ints : int -> int Seq.t = <fun>
```

As a fun fact, one should observe `map` over sequences can be implemented using
`Seq.unfold`. Here is how to write it:
```ocaml
# let map f = Seq.unfold (fun s -> s |> Seq.uncons |> Option.map (fun (x, y) -> (f x, y)));;
val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a Seq.t -> 'b Seq.t = <fun>
```
Here is a quick check:
```ocaml
# Seq.ints 0 |> map (fun x -> x * x) |> Seq.take 10 |> List.of_seq;;
- : int list = [0; 1; 4; 9; 16; 25; 36; 49; 64; 81]
```
The function `Seq.uncons` returns the head and tail of a sequence if it is not
empty, or it otherwise returns `None`.

Using this function:
```ocaml
let input_line_opt chan =
  try Some (input_line chan, chan)
  with End_of_file -> close_in chan; None
```
It is possible to read a file using `Seq.unfold`:
```ocaml
"README.md" |> open_in |> Seq.unfold input_line_opt |> Seq.iter print_endline
```

Although this can be an appealing style, bear in mind that it does not prevent
taking care of open files. While the code above is fine, this one no longer is:
```ocaml
"README.md" |> open_in |> Seq.unfold input_line_opt |> Seq.take 10 |> Seq.iter print_endline
```
Here, `close_in` will never be called over the input channel opened on
`README.md`.

## Sequences Are Functions

Although this looks like a possible way to define the [Fibonacci
sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):
```ocaml
# let rec fibs m n = Seq.cons m (fibs n (n + m));;
val fibs : int -> int -> int Seq.t = <fun>
```
It actually isn't. It's a non-ending recursion which blows away the stack.
```
# fibs 0 1;;
Stack overflow during evaluation (looping recursion?).
```
This definition is behaving as expected (spot the differences, there are four):
```ocaml
# let rec fibs m n () = Seq.Cons (m, fibs n (n + m));;
val fibs : int -> int -> int Seq.t = <fun>
```
It can be used to produce some Fibonacci numbers:
```ocaml
# fibs 0 1 |> Seq.take 10 |> List.of_seq;;
- : int list = [0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34]
```
Why is it so? The key difference lies in the recursive call `fibs n (n + m)`. In
the former definition, the application is complete because `fibs` is provided
with all the arguments it expects. In the latter definition, the application is
partial because the `()` argument is missing. Since evaluation is
[eager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Eager_evaluation) in
OCaml, in the former case, evaluation of the recursive call is triggered and a
non-terminating looping occurs. In contrast, in the latter case, the partially
applied function is immediately returned as a
[closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)).

Sequences are functions, as stated by their type:
```ocaml
# #show Seq.t;;
type 'a t = unit -> 'a Seq.node
```
Functions working with sequences must be written accordingly.
* Sequence consumer: partially applied function parameter
* Sequence producer: partially applied function result

When code dealing with sequences does not behave as expected, like if it is
crashing or hanging, there's a fair chance a mistake like in the first
definition of `fibs` was made.

## Sequences for Conversions

Throughout the standard library, sequences are used as a bridge to perform
conversions between many datatypes. For instance, here are the signatures of
some of those functions:
* Lists
  ```ocaml
  val List.of_seq : 'a list -> 'a Seq.t
  val List.to_seq : 'a Seq.t -> 'a list
  ```
* Arrays
  ```ocaml
  val Array.of_seq : 'a array -> 'a Seq.t
  val Array.to_seq : 'a Seq.t -> 'a array
  ```
* Strings
  ```ocaml
  val String.of_seq : string -> char Seq.t
  val String.to_seq : char Seq.t -> string
  ```
Similar functions are also provided for sets, maps, hash tables (`Hashtbl`), and
others (except `Seq`, obviously). When implementing a datatype module, it is
advised to expose `to_seq` and `of_seq` functions.

## Miscellaneous Considerations

There are a couple of related libraries, all providing means to handle large
flows of data:

* Rizo I [Streaming](/p/streaming)
* Simon Cruanes and Gabriel Radanne [Iter](/p/iter)
* Simon Cruanes [OSeq](/p/oseq) (an extension of `Seq` with more functions)
* Jane Street `Base.Sequence`

There used to be a module called [`Stream`](/releases/4.13/api/Stream.html) in
the OCaml standard library. It was
[removed](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10482) in 2021 with the release of
OCaml 4.14. Beware books and documentation written before may still mention it.
