Memoization is a powerful technique for speeding up simple recursive
algorithms, without having to change the way the algorithm works. This is done
by "remembering" the results of a computation, so that previously computed results
never have to be recomputed. We'll illustrate the principle using
imperative data structures, e.g. arrays and hash tables.

The following is an excerpt of the page ["Memoization"](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/ds/memoization.html) from the book [OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html), reproduced here with permission.

## Fibonacci

Let's again consider the problem of computing the nth Fibonacci number.
The naive recursive implementation takes exponential time, because of the
recomputation of the same Fibonacci numbers over and over again:

```ocaml
let rec fib n = if n < 2 then 1 else fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

<div class="note">

**Note:** To be precise, its running time turns out to be O(p&#8319;), where p is the
golden ratio, (1 + &Sqrt;5)/2.
</div>

If we record Fibonacci numbers as they are computed, we can avoid this redundant
work. The idea is that whenever we compute `f n`, we store it in a table indexed
by `n`. In this case the indexing keys are integers, so we can use implement
this table using an array:

```ocaml
let fibm n =
  let memo : int option array = Array.make (n + 1) None in
  let rec f_mem n =
    match memo.(n) with
    | Some result -> (* computed already *) result
    | None ->
        let result =
          if n < 2 then 1 else f_mem (n - 1) + f_mem (n - 2)
        in
        (* record in table *)
        memo.(n) <- Some result;
        result
  in
  f_mem n
```

The function `f_mem` defined inside `fibm` contains the original recursive
algorithm, except before doing that calculation it first checks if the result
has already been computed and stored in the table in which case it simply
returns the result.

How do we analyze the running time of this function? The time spent in a single
call to `f_mem` is O(1) if we exclude the time spent in any recursive calls
that it happens to make. Now we look for a way to bound the total number of
recursive calls by finding some measure of the progress that is being made.

A good choice of progress measure, not only here but also for many uses of
memoization, is the number of nonempty entries in the table (i.e. entries that
contain `Some n` rather than `None`). Each time `f_mem` makes the two recursive
calls it also increases the number of nonempty entries by one (filling in a
formerly empty entry in the table with a new value). Since the table has only
`n` entries, there can thus only be a total of O(`n`) calls to `f_mem`, for a
total running time of O(`n`) (because we established above that each call takes
O(1) time). This speedup from memoization thus reduces the running time from
exponential to linear, a huge change---e.g., for `n`=4 the speedup from
memoization is more than a factor of a million!

The key to being able to apply memoization is that there are common sub-problems
which are being solved repeatedly. Thus we are able to use some extra storage to
save on repeated computation.

Although this code uses imperative constructs (specifically, array update), the
side effects are not visible outside the function `fibm`. So from a client's
perspective, `fibm` is functional. There's no need to mention the imperative
implementation (i.e., the benign side effects) that are used internally.

## Memoization Using Higher-order Functions

Now that we've seen an example of memoizing one function, let's use higher-order
functions to memoize any function. First, consider the case of memoizing a
non-recursive function `f`. In that case we simply need to create a hash table
that stores the corresponding value for each argument that `f` is called with
(and to memoize multi-argument functions we can use currying and uncurrying to
convert to a single argument function).

```ocaml
let memo f =
  let h = Hashtbl.create 11 in
  fun x ->
    try Hashtbl.find h x
    with Not_found ->
      let y = f x in
      Hashtbl.add h x y;
      y
```

For recursive functions, however, the recursive call structure needs to be
modified. This can be abstracted out independent of the function that is being
memoized:

```ocaml
let memo_rec f =
  let h = Hashtbl.create 16 in
  let rec g x =
    try Hashtbl.find h x
    with Not_found ->
      let y = f g x in
      Hashtbl.add h x y;
      y
  in
  g
```

Now we can slightly rewrite the original `fib` function above using this general
memoization technique:

```ocaml
let fib_memo =
  let rec fib self n =
    if n < 2 then 1 else self (n - 1) + self (n - 2)
  in
  memo_rec fib
```

## Just for Fun: Party Optimization

Suppose we want to throw a party for a company whose org chart is a binary tree.
Each employee has an associated “fun value” and we want the set of invited
employees to have a maximum total fun value. However, no employee is fun if his
superior is invited, so we never invite two employees who are connected in the
org chart. (The less fun name for this problem is the maximum weight independent
set in a tree.) For an org chart with `n` employees, there are 2&#8319; possible 
invitation lists, so the naive algorithm that compares the fun of every valid 
invitation list takes exponential time.

We can use memoization to turn this into a linear-time algorithm. We start by
defining a variant type to represent the employees. The int at each node is the
fun.

```ocaml
type tree = Empty | Node of int * tree * tree
```

Now, how can we solve this recursively? One important observation is that in any
tree, the optimal invitation list that doesn't include the root node will be the
union of optimal invitation lists for the left and right subtrees. And the
optimal invitation list that does include the root node will be the union of
optimal invitation lists for the left and right children that do not include
their respective root nodes. So it seems useful to have functions that optimize
the invite lists for the case where the root node is required to be invited, and
for the case where the root node is excluded. We'll call these two functions
party_in and party_out. Then the result of party is just the maximum of these
two functions:

```ocaml
module Unmemoized = struct
  type tree =
    | Empty
    | Node of int * tree * tree

  (* Returns optimum fun for t. *)
  let rec party t = max (party_in t) (party_out t)

  (* Returns optimum fun for t assuming the root node of t
   * is included. *)
  and party_in t =
    match t with
    | Empty -> 0
    | Node (v, left, right) -> v + party_out left + party_out right

  (* Returns optimum fun for t assuming the root node of t
   * is excluded. *)
  and party_out t =
    match t with
    | Empty -> 0
    | Node (v, left, right) -> party left + party right
end
```

This code has exponential running time. But notice that there are only `n`
possible distinct calls to party. If we change the code to memoize the results
of these calls, the performance will be linear in `n`. Here is a version that
memoizes the result of party and also computes the actual invitation lists.
Notice that this code memoizes results directly in the tree.

```ocaml
module Memoized = struct
  (* This version memoizes the optimal fun value for each tree node. It
     also remembers the best invite list. Each tree node has the name of
     the employee as a string. *)
  type tree =
    | Empty
    | Node of
        int * string * tree * tree * (int * string list) option ref

  let rec party t : int * string list =
    match t with
    | Empty -> (0, [])
    | Node (_, name, left, right, memo) -> (
        match !memo with
        | Some result -> result
        | None ->
            let infun, innames = party_in t in
            let outfun, outnames = party_out t in
            let result =
              if infun > outfun then (infun, innames)
              else (outfun, outnames)
            in
            memo := Some result;
            result)

  and party_in t =
    match t with
    | Empty -> (0, [])
    | Node (v, name, l, r, _) ->
        let lfun, lnames = party_out l and rfun, rnames = party_out r in
        (v + lfun + rfun, name :: lnames @ rnames)

  and party_out t =
    match t with
    | Empty -> (0, [])
    | Node (_, _, l, r, _) ->
        let lfun, lnames = party l and rfun, rnames = party r in
        (lfun + rfun, lnames @ rnames)
end
```

Why was memoization so effective for solving this problem? As with the Fibonacci
algorithm, we had the overlapping sub-problems property, in which the naive
recursive implementation called the function party many times with the same
arguments. Memoization saves all those calls. Further, the party optimization
problem has the property of optimal substructure, meaning that the optimal
answer to a problem is computed from optimal answers to sub-problems. Not all
optimization problems have this property. The key to using memoization
effectively for optimization problems is to figure out how to write a recursive
function that implements the algorithm and has two properties. Sometimes this
requires thinking carefully.

MRC 7/22/21: the section below needs a lot more explanation. Also the value
`big` was undefined in the original notes, so the code didn't compile.
I added a definition of `target + 1` but IDK whether that's "big enough".

## Optimal Line Breaking

Here is a more involved example. Suppose that we have some text that we want to
format as a paragraph within a certain column width. For example, we might have
to do this if we were writing a web browser. For simplicity we will assume that
all characters have the same width. A formatting of the text consists of
choosing certain pairs of words to put line breaks in between. For example, when
applied to the list of words in this paragraph, with width 60, we want output
like the following:

```ocaml
let it =
  ["Here is a more involved example of memoization. Suppose that",
   "we have some text that we want to format as a paragraph",
   ...
   "applied to the list of words in this paragraph, with width",
   "60, we want output like the following:"] : string list
```

A good formatting uses up a lot of each column, and also gives each line similar
widths. The greedy approach would be to just fill each line as much as possible,
but this can result in lines with very different lengths. For example, if we
format the string “this may be a difficult example” at a width of 13 characters,
we get a formatting that could be improved:

```text
this may be a
difficult
example
```

Note that the optimal splitting is:
```text
this may be
a difficult
example
```

The TeX formatting program does a good job of keeping line widths similar by
finding the formatting that minimizes the sum of the cube of the leftover space
in each line (except for the last). However, for `n` words, there are
$\Omega(2^n)$ possible formattings, so the algorithm can't possibly check them
all for large text inputs. Remarkably, we can use memoization to find the
optimal formatting efficiently. In fact, memoization is useful for many
optimization problems.

We start by writing a simple recursive algorithm to walk down the list and try
either inserting a line break after each word, or not inserting a linebreak:

```ocaml
(** Result of formatting a string. A result [(lst, n)] means a string
    was formatted into the lines in [lst], with a total sum-of-cubes
    cost of [n]. Invariant: the list is never empty. *)
type break_result = string list * int

(** Result: format the words in [words] into a list of lines optimally,
    minimizing the sum of the cubes of differences between the line
    lengths and [target]. Performance: worst-case time is exponential in
    the number of words. *)
let linebreak1 (words : string list) (target : int) : string list =
  let rec lb (clen : int) (words : string list) : break_result =
    match words with
    | [] -> ([ "" ], 0) (* no charge for last line *)
    | word :: rest ->
        (* Try two ways of doing it: (1) insert a linebreak right after
           current word, or (2) continue the current line. Pick the
           better one. *)
        let wlen = String.length word in
        let contlen = if clen = 0 then wlen else clen + 1 + wlen in
        let l1, c1' = lb 0 rest in
        let cube x = x * x * x in
        let c1 = c1' + cube (target - contlen) in
        if contlen <= target then
          match lb contlen rest with
          | [], _ -> failwith "invariant violated"
          | h2 :: t2, c2 ->
              if c1 < c2 then (word :: l1, c1)
              else
                ((if h2 = "" then word else word ^ " " ^ h2) :: t2, c2)
        else
          let big = target + 1 in
          (word :: l1, big)
  in
  let result, cost = lb 0 words in
  result
```

This algorithm is exponential because it computes all possible formattings. It
is therefore much too slow to be practical.

The key observation is that in the optimal formatting of a paragraph of text,
the formatting of the text past any given point is the optimal formatting of
just that text, given that its first character starts at the column position
where the prior formatted text ends. Thus, the formatting problem has optimal
substructure when cast in this way.

So if we compute the best formatting after a particular line break position,
that formatting is the best for all possible formattings of the text before the
break.

We can make `linebreak` take linear time by memoizing the best formatting for
the calls where `clen = 0`. (We could memoize all calls, but that wouldn't
improve speed much.) This requires just introducing a function `lb_mem` that
looks up and records memoized formatting results:

```ocaml
(** Result of formatting a string. A result [(lst, n)] means a string
    was formatted into the lines in [lst], with a total sum-of-cubes
    cost of [n]. Invariant: the list is never empty. *)
type break_result = string list * int

(* Same spec as linebreak1. Performance: worst-case time is linear in
   the number of words. *)
let linebreak2 (words : string list) (target : int) : string list =
  let memo : break_result option array =
    Array.make (List.length words + 1) None
  in
  let rec lb_mem (words : string list) : break_result =
    let n = List.length words in
    match Array.get memo n with
    | Some br -> br
    | None ->
        let br = lb 0 words in
        Array.set memo n (Some br);
        br
  and lb (clen : int) (words : string list) : break_result =
    match words with
    | [] -> ([ "" ], 0) (* no charge for last line *)
    | word :: rest -> (
        let wlen = String.length word in
        let contlen = if clen = 0 then wlen else clen + 1 + wlen in
        let l1, c1' = lb_mem rest in
        let c1 = c1' + cube (target - contlen) in
        if contlen > target then
          let big = target + 1 in
          (word :: l1, big)
        else
          match lb contlen rest with
          | [], _ -> failwith "invariant violated"
          | h2 :: t2, c2 ->
              if c1 < c2 then (word :: l1, c1)
              else
                ((if h2 = "" then word else word ^ " " ^ h2) :: t2, c2))
  in
  let result, cost = lb 0 words in
  result
```
