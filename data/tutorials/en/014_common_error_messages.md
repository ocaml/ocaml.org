This page gives a list of quick explanations for some error or warning
messages that are emitted by the OCaml compilers. Longer explanations
are usually given in dedicated sections of this tutorial.

## Type errors
###  This expression has type ... but is here used with type ...
When the type of an object is not compatible with the context in which
it is used, it is frequent to obtain this kind of message:

```ocaml
# 1 + 2.5
Line 1, characters 5-8:
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int
```
"This expression has type *X* but is here used with type *Y*" means that
if the contents of the expression is isolated (2.5), its type is
inferred as *X* (float). But the context, i.e. everything which is
around (1 + ...) tells that the gap expects an expression of type *Y*
(int) which is not compatible with *X*.

More disturbing is the following message:

```text
This expression has type my_type but is here used with type my_type
```
This error happens often while testing some type definitions using the
interactive toplevel.  In OCaml, it is perfectly legal
to define a type with a name
that is already taken by another type. Consider the following session:

```ocaml
# type my_type = A | B
type my_type = A | B
# let a = A
val a : my_type = A
# type my_type = A | B
type my_type = A | B
# let b = B
val b : my_type = B
# a = b
Line 1, characters 5-6:
Error: This expression has type my_type/1
       but an expression was expected of type my_type/2
       Hint: The type my_type has been defined multiple times in this
         toplevel session. Some toplevel values still refer to old versions
         of this type. Did you try to redefine them?
```
For the compiler, the second definition of my_type is totally
independent from the first definition. So we have defined two types
which have the same name. Since "a" was defined earlier, it belongs to
the first type while "b" belongs to the second type. In this example,
redefining "a" after the last definition of my_type solves the problem.
This kind of problem should not happen in real programs unless you use
the same name for the same type in the same module, which is highly
discouraged.

###  Warning: This optional argument cannot be erased
Functions with optional arguments must have at least one non-labelled
argument. For instance, this is not OK:

```ocaml
# let f ?(x = 0) ?(y = 0) = print_int (x + y)
Line 1, characters 18-23:
Warning 16: this optional argument cannot be erased.
val f : ?x:int -> ?y:int -> unit = <fun>
```
The solution is simply to add one argument of type unit, like this:

```ocaml
# let f ?(x = 0) ?(y = 0) () = print_int (x + y)
val f : ?x:int -> ?y:int -> unit -> unit = <fun>
```
See the [Labels](labels.html "Labels") section for more details on
functions with labelled arguments.

###  The type of this expression... contains type variables that cannot be generalized
This happens in some cases when the full type of an object is not known
by the compiler when it reaches the end of the compilation unit (file)
but for some reason it cannot remain polymorphic. Example:

```ocaml env=ref
# let x = ref None
val x : '_weak1 option ref = {contents = None}
```
triggers the following message during the compilation:

```text
The type of this expression, '_a option ref,
contains type variables that cannot be generalized
```

Solution: help the compiler with a type annotation, like for instance:

```ocaml env=ref
# let x : string option ref = ref None
val x : string option ref = {contents = None}
```
or:

```ocaml env=ref
# let x = ref (None : string option)
val x : string option ref = {contents = None}
```

Data of type `'_weak<n>` may be allowed temporarily, for instance during a
toplevel session. It means that the given object has an unknown type,
but it cannot be any type: it is not polymorphic data. In the toplevel,
our example gives these results:

```ocaml env=ref
# let x = ref None
val x : '_weak2 option ref = {contents = None}
```

The compiler tells us that the type of x is not fully known yet. But by
using `x` later, the compiler can infer the type of `x`:

```ocaml env=ref
# x := Some 0
- : unit = ()
```
Now `x` has a known type:

```ocaml env=ref
# x
- : int option ref = {contents = Some 0}
```

## Pattern matching warnings and errors
###  This pattern is unused
This warning should be considered as an error, since there is no reason
to intentionally keep such code. It may happen when the programmer
introduced a catch-all pattern unintentionally such as in the following
situation:

```ocaml
# let test_member x tup =
  match tup with
  | (y, _) | (_, y) when y = x -> true
  | _ -> false
Line 3, characters 14-20:
Warning 12: this sub-pattern is unused.
Line 3, characters 5-20:
Warning 57: Ambiguous or-pattern variables under guard;
variable y may match different arguments. (See manual section 9.5)
val test_member : 'a -> 'a * 'a -> bool = <fun>
```
Obviously, the programmer had a misconception of what OCaml's pattern
matching is about. Remember the following:

* the tree of cases is traversed linearly, from left to right. There
 is *no backtracking* as in regexp matching.
* a guard ("when" clause) is not part of a pattern. It is simply a
 condition which is evaluated at most once and is used as a last
 resort to jump to the next match case.
* lowercase identifiers (bindings such as "y" above) are just names,
 so they will always match.

In our example, it is now clear that only the first item of the pair
will ever be tested. This leads to the following results:

```ocaml
# test_member 1 (1, 0)
- : bool = true
# test_member 1 (0, 1)
- : bool = false
```
###  This pattern-matching is not exhaustive
OCaml's pattern matching can check whether a set of patterns is
exhaustive or not, based on the *type* only. So in the following
example, the compiler doesn't know what range of ints the "mod" operator
would return:

```ocamltop
let is_even x =
  match x mod 2 with
  | 0 -> true
  | 1 | -1 -> false
```
A short solution without pattern matching would be:

```ocaml
# let is_even x = x mod 2 = 0
val is_even : int -> bool = <fun>
```
In general, that kind of simplification is not possible and the best
solution is to add a catch-all case which should never be reached:

```ocaml
# let is_even x =
  match x mod 2 with
  | 0 -> true
  | 1 | -1 -> false
  | _ -> assert false
val is_even : int -> bool = <fun>
```

## Problems recompiling valid programs
###  x.cmi is not a compiled interface
When recompiling some old program or compiling a program from an
external source that was not cleaned properly, it is possible to get
this error message:

```text
some_module.cmi is not a compiled interface
```

It means that some_module.cmi is not valid according to the *current
version* of the OCaml compiler. Most of the time, removing the old
compiled files (*.cmi, *.cmo, *.cmx, ...) and recompiling is
sufficient to solve this problem.
	
###  Warning: Illegal backslash escape in string
Recent versions of OCaml warn you against unprotected backslashes in
strings since they should be doubled. Such a message may be displayed
when compiling an older program, and can be turned off with the `-w x`
option.

```ocaml
# "\e\n" (* bad practice *)
File "_none_", line 1, characters 1-3:
Warning 14: illegal backslash escape in string.
- : string = "\\e\n"
# "\\e\n" (* good practice *)
- : string = "\\e\n"
```
