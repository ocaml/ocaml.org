In [Understanding the Garbage Collector](/docs/garbage-collector), discussed how Garbage Collection in OCaml works.
In this tutorial, we look at how to use the `Gc` module and how to write your own finalisers.
At the end of the tutorial, we give some exercises you might try in order to develop a better understanding.

## The `Gc` Module
The `Gc` module contains some useful functions for querying and calling
the garbage collector from OCaml programs.

Here is a program that runs and then prints out GC statistics just
before quitting:

<!-- TODO: Probably write a GC example without dependencies -->

<!-- $MDX file=examples/gc.ml -->
```ocaml
let rec iterate r x_init i =
  if i = 1 then x_init
  else
    let x = iterate r x_init (i - 1) in
    r *. x *. (1.0 -. x)

let () =
  Random.self_init ();
  Graphics.open_graph " 640x480";
  for x = 0 to 640 do
    let r = 4.0 *. float_of_int x /. 640.0 in
    for i = 0 to 39 do
      let x_init = Random.float 1.0 in
      let x_final = iterate r x_init 500 in
      let y = int_of_float (x_final *. 480.) in
      Graphics.plot x y
    done
  done;
  Gc.print_stat stdout
```

Here is what it printed out for me:

```
minor_words: 115926165     # Total number of words allocated
promoted_words: 31217      # Promoted from minor -> major
major_words: 31902         # Large objects allocated in major directly
minor_collections: 3538    # Number of minor heap collections
major_collections: 39      # Number of major heap collections
heap_words: 63488          # Size of the heap, in words = approx. 256K
heap_chunks: 1
top_heap_words: 63488
live_words: 2694
live_blocks: 733
free_words: 60794
free_blocks: 4
largest_free: 31586
fragments: 0
compactions: 0
```

We can see that minor heap collections are approximately 100 times more
frequent than major heap collections (in this example, not necessarily
in general). Over the lifetime of the program, an astonishing 440 MB of
memory was allocated. Of course, most of that would have been
immediately freed in a minor collection. Only about 128K was promoted to
long-term storage on the major heap, and another 128K consisted of
large objects which would have been allocated directly onto the major
heap.

We can instruct the GC to print out debugging messages when one of
several events happen (e.g., on every major collection). Try adding the
following code to the example above near the beginning:

<!-- $MDX skip -->
```ocaml
# Gc.set {(Gc.get ()) with Gc.verbose = 0x01}
```

(We haven't seen the `{ expression with field = value }` form before,
but it should be mostly obvious what it does). The above code
causes the GC to print a message at the start of every major collection.

## Finalisation and the Weak Module
We can write a function called a **finaliser** which is called when an
object is about to be freed by the GC.

The `Weak` module lets us create so-called weak pointers. A **weak
pointer** is best defined by comparing it to a "normal pointer". When we
have an ordinary OCaml object, we reference that object through a name
(e.g., `let name = ... in`) or through another object. The garbage
collector sees that we have a reference to that object and won't collect
it. That's what you might call a "normal pointer." If, however, you hold
a weak pointer or weak reference to an object, then you hint to the
garbage collector that it may collect the object at any time. (Not
necessarily that it *will* collect the object.) When
you come to examine the object later, you can either turn your weak pointer
into a normal pointer, or you can be informed that the GC did
actually collect the object.

Finalisation and weak pointers can be used together to implement an
in-memory object database cache.

Let's imagine that we have a very large
number of large user records in a file on disk. This is far too much
data to be loaded into memory all at once. Plus, other programs
might access the data on the disk, so we need to lock individual records
when we hold copies of them in memory.

The *public* interface to our "in-memory object database cache" is going
to be just two functions:

<!-- $MDX skip -->
```ocaml
type record = {mutable name : string; mutable address : string}
val get_record : int -> record
val sync_records : unit -> unit
```

The `get_record` call is the only call that most programs will need to
make. It gets the n<sup>th</sup> record either out of the cache or from
disk and returns it. The program can then read and/or update the
`record.name` and `record.address` fields. The program then just
literally forgets about the record! Behind the scenes, finalisation is
going to write the record back out to disk at some later point in time.

The `sync_records` function can also be called by user programs. This
function synchronises the disk copy and in-memory copies of all records.

OCaml doesn't currently run finalisers at exit. However you can easily
force it to by adding the following command to your code. This command
causes a full major GC cycle on exit:

<!-- $MDX skip -->
```ocaml
at_exit Gc.full_major
```

Our code is also going to implement a cache of recently accessed records
using the `Weak` module. The advantage of using the `Weak` module rather
than hand-rolling our own code is two-fold. Firstly, the garbage
collector has a global view of memory requirements for the whole
program, so it's in a better position to decide when to shrink the
cache. Secondly, our code will be much simpler.

For our example, we're going to use a very simple format for the file of
users' records. The file is just a list of user records, with each user
record having a fixed size of 256 bytes. Each user record has just two
fields (padded with spaces if necessary): the name field (64 bytes) and
the address field (192 bytes). Before a record can be loaded into
memory, the program must acquire an exclusive lock on the record. After
the in-memory copy is written back out to the file, the program must
release the lock. Here is some code to define the on-disk format and
some low-level functions to read, write, lock, and unlock records:


<!-- $MDX file=examples/objcache.ml,part=0 -->
```ocaml
(* In-memory format. *)
type record = { mutable name : string; mutable address : string }

(* On-disk format. *)
let record_size = 256
let name_size = 64
let addr_size = 192

(* Low-level load/save records to file. *)
let seek_record n fd = ignore (Unix.lseek fd (n * record_size) Unix.SEEK_SET)

let write_record record n fd =
  seek_record n fd;
  ignore (Unix.write fd (Bytes.of_string record.name) 0 name_size);
  ignore (Unix.write fd (Bytes.of_string record.address) 0 addr_size)

let read_record record n fd =
  seek_record n fd;
  ignore (Unix.read fd (Bytes.of_string record.name) 0 name_size);
  ignore (Unix.read fd (Bytes.of_string record.address) 0 addr_size)

(* Lock/unlock the nth record in a file. *)
let lock_record n fd =
  seek_record n fd;
  Unix.lockf fd Unix.F_LOCK record_size

let unlock_record n fd =
  seek_record n fd;
  Unix.lockf fd Unix.F_ULOCK record_size
```

We also need a function to create new, empty in-memory `record` objects:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/objcache.ml,part=1 -->
```ocaml
(* Create a new, empty record. *)
let new_record () =
  { name = String.make name_size ' '; address = String.make addr_size ' ' }
```


Because this is a really simple program, we're going to fix the number
of records in advance:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/objcache.ml,part=2 -->
```ocaml
(* Total number of records. *)
let nr_records = 10000

(* On-disk file. *)
let diskfile = Unix.openfile "users.bin" [ Unix.O_RDWR; Unix.O_CREAT ] 0o666
```

Download [users.bin.gz](/media/tutorials/users.bin.gz) and decompress it before
running the program.

Our cache of records is very simple:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/objcache.ml,part=3 -->
```ocaml
(* Cache of records. *)
let cache = Weak.create nr_records
```

The `get_record` function is very short and basically composed of two
halves. We grab the record from the cache. If the cache gives us `None`,
then that either means that we haven't loaded this record from the cache
yet, or it has been written out to disk (finalised) and dropped
from the cache. If the cache gives us `Some record`, then we just return
`record` (this promotes the weak pointer to the record to a normal
pointer).


<!-- $MDX file=examples/objcache.ml,part=4 -->
```ocaml
(* The finaliser function. *)
let finaliser n record =
  printf "*** objcache: finalising record %d\n%!" n;
  write_record record n diskfile;
  unlock_record n diskfile

(* Get a record from the cache or off disk. *)
let get_record n =
  match Weak.get cache n with
  | Some record ->
      printf "*** objcache: fetching record %d from memory cache\n%!" n;
      record
  | None ->
      printf "*** objcache: loading record %d from disk\n%!" n;
      let record = new_record () in
      Gc.finalise (finaliser n) record;
      lock_record n diskfile;
      read_record record n diskfile;
      Weak.set cache n (Some record);
      record
```

The `sync_records` function is even easier. First of all, it empties the
cache by replacing all the weak pointers with `None`. This now means
that the garbage collector *can* collect and finalise all of those
records. But it doesn't necessarily mean that the GC *will* collect the
records straightaway. In fact it's not likely that it will, so to force
the GC to collect the records immediately, we also invoke a major cycle.


Finally, we have some test code. I won't reproduce the test code here, but you
can download the complete program and test code
[objcache.ml](/media/tutorials/objcache.ml) and compile it with:

<!-- $MDX dir=examples -->
```sh
$ ocamlc unix.cma objcache.ml -o objcache
```

## Exercises
Here are some ways to extend the example above, in approximately
increasing order of difficulty:

1. Implement the record as an **object**, and allow it to transparently
 pad/unpad strings. You will need to provide methods to set and get
 the name and address fields (four public methods in all). Hide as
 much of the implementation (file access, locking) code in the class
 as possible.
1. Extend the program so it acquires a **read lock** on getting
 the record, but upgrades this to a **write lock** just before the
 user updates any field.
1. Support a **variable number of records**, and add a function to
 create a new record (in the file). [Tip: OCaml has support for weak
 hashtables.]
1. Add support for **variable-length records**.
1. Make the underlying file representation a **DBM-style hash**.
1. Provide a general-purpose cache fronting a "users" table in your
 choice of **relational database** (with locking).
