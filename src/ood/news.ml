We already have a codebase of tens of thousands of lines of code, with several web applications that are data intensive and communicate with backend services written in <a href=\"http://ocaml.org/\">OCaml</a>, using tools like\194\160<a href=\"https://github.com/ahrefs/atd\">atd</a>.</p><p>Given our investment in these technologies, we have been following closely the recent changes in <a href=\"https://rescript-lang.org/\">ReScript</a>, with its rebrand and renaming, and the split with the ReasonML project, explained in the project <a href=\"https://rescript-lang.org/blog/bucklescript-is-rebranding\">blog\194\160post</a>.</p><h3>ReScript: becoming its own\194\160language</h3><p>We are excited about the way ReScript is unifying the experience and making it easier for developers who are getting started to find documentation in a single place, as well as continuing its strong focus on performance and readable JavaScript output.</p><p>On the other hand, we are trying to figure out the implications of this change in the mid- and long-term, especially regarding the integration with the OCaml ecosystem. And more importantly, what this evolution will mean for production users like us who rely on this integration.</p><p>ReScript integration with OCaml has historically been seamless, as BuckleScript started originally as a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ocaml/comments/4enok3/bloombergbucklescript_a_back_end_for_the_ocaml/\">new backend for the OCaml compiler</a>. However, in recent months, there have been several hints that ReScript wants to evolve towards becoming its own language:</p><ul><li>It has now <a href=\"https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax\">its own parser</a>, incompatible with OCaml native applications</li><li>Official repository guidelines for technical writing mentions explicitly that <a href=\"https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-lang.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#technical-writing-documentation\">no reference to OCaml</a> should appear in\194\160docs</li><li>Upgrades to the latest version of OCaml compiler, which <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210208054855if_/https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/wiki\">used to be part of the roadmap</a>, have been <a href=\"https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/some-thoughts-on-community-building/1474\">deprioritized</a> recently.</li></ul><p>So, even if officially ReScript has not announced that they will break backwards compatibility with OCaml, just the fact that it is sticking with an old version of the OCaml compiler poses some challenges for us in terms of tooling. The uncertainty about the future and the pace of changes add some risk to the high-level goals we have for our teams and codebase: we would like to share <em>more</em> code between frontend and backend, not\194\160less.</p><h3>Melange: a fork of ReScript, focused on OCaml compatibility</h3><p>When Ant\195\179nio Monteiro <a href=\"https://anmonteiro.com/2021/03/on-ocaml-and-the-js-platform/\">announced Melange</a>, a fork of ReScript but with a strong focus on keeping compatibility with OCaml, we decided to try it out and see how it could work for\194\160us.</p><p>Ultimately, the experiment was successful. We managed to build all our frontend applications with Melange, while keeping the existing bundling setup, which currently uses\194\160Webpack.</p><p>Throughout this process, we had to modify some parts of the code. We will now go through the most relevant parts of the\194\160process:</p><ul><li>Upgrade to OCaml 4.12: the most relevant part was the deprecation of Pervasives module to use\194\160Stdlib.</li><li>Use ppxlib in our ppxs: we had to upgrade the two ppxs that we use in the frontend codebase to the latest compiler version, <a href=\"https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-emotion/compare/master...jchavarri:ocaml4.12-ppxlib\">bs-emotion-ppx</a> and an in-house <a href=\"https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-react-intl-ppx\">ppx for internationalization</a>.</li><li>Configure esy: we were already using esy to bring the editor tooling into scope of the developer environment, so we just had to make sure melange would also be included in the json configuration.</li><li>Upgrade to Reason 3.7.0: a quite simple change too, as the whole process is automated by using refmt. As a side note, we ran into <a href=\"https://github.com/reasonml/reason/issues/2636\">a small bug</a> with some type annotations, that we were able to work\194\160around.</li><li>\226\128\156Lift\226\128\157 dune workspace to the root of our monorepo: this is probably the most intrusive change. Because we have shared code between backend and frontend, and Dune needs to have access to all sources under its workspace, we had to \226\128\156lift\226\128\157 the Dune workspace from the backend directory to the root of monorepo.</li></ul><h3>The good</h3><p>This experiment allowed us to experience what a project like Melange could offer for our use case. Here are some of the things we might be able to leverage in a codebase built with\194\160Melange:</p><ul><li>Recent version of the OCaml compiler: at some point, we could pin compiler version between backend and frontend teams, making upgrades more straightforward as they would happen atomically.</li><li>Shared editor tooling: the official OCaml <a href=\"https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform\">vscode extension</a> works great with Melange, as well as any other OCaml editor integration. Having backend and frontend teams use similar editor setup removes a lot of maintenance work for\194\160us.</li><li>Consuming ppxs from source: Melange allows to consume ppxs from source, which also removes issues with pre-compiled ppxs (like this issue with the recent <a href=\"https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-emotion/issues/53\">M1\194\160Macs</a>).</li><li>Melange allows to run all ppxs <a href=\"https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/171\">from a single executable file</a>, which has some nice performance benefits.</li><li>Use Dune for atd files generators: ReScript \226\128\156generators\226\128\157 are unfortunately <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200710044513if_/https://reasonml.org/docs/reason-compiler/latest/build-advanced\">not documented anymore</a>, but we use them extensively for atd file generation. Being able to share Dune rules in backend and frontend would make our build setup\194\160easier.</li><li>Access to OCaml documentation tooling: Melange allows to leverage existing tooling for generating documentation, like\194\160<a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/\">odoc</a>.</li><li>Async syntax: the latest Reason version <a href=\"https://github.com/reasonml/reason/pull/2487\">supports \226\128\156let op\226\128\157 syntax</a>, which is handy for client-side code.</li></ul><h3>The bad</h3><p>While there are many things that are exciting about Melange, there are some other parts that can be improved.</p><ul><li>Build performance: We already knew that performance would be far worse than ReScript, as Melange uses Dune in a way that it was not designed for. In our tests, builds with Melange are roughly 1 order of magnitude slower than ReScript\194\160ones.</li><li>First-class Dune support: if there was a deeper integration between Dune and Melange, we could explore features like shared libraries or shared rules between backend and frontend. As of today, Dune has no knowledge about Melange environment, so it can perform basic rules execution, but there is no access to high level stanzas like library in\194\160Melange.</li><li>Two-headed goal: finally, we see a more strategic risk in Melange proposition. Right now it has two goals: keep compatibility with both ReScript and OCaml. But we don\226\128\153t know how long these goals will be feasible. If at some point ReScript decides to move away from the OCaml compiler fully, then Melange users would not be able to consume any updates to the ReScript ecosystem anymore.</li></ul><h3>Alright, but are you migrating to Melange or ReScript?</h3><p>With all the information available, the answer is: we don\226\128\153t know yet. \240\159\152\132 We want to keep exploring all the available options and have as much information as possible before committing further. So for now, we are upgrading the codebase to recent versions of ReScript, but we are holding up on features that only work one way. For example, we have not migrated our codebase to the ReScript syntax yet, as <a href=\"https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/issues/405\">there is no way to translate back to Reason\194\160syntax</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, we will keep exploring how far the limitations of Melange can be mitigated. To be continued! \240\159\154\128</p><p><em>Thanks to Igor and Feihong for reviewing and improving earlier versions of this\194\160post.</em></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9f881f6d022b\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://tech.ahrefs.com/building-ahrefs-codebase-with-melange-9f881f6d022b\">Building Ahrefs codebase with Melange</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://tech.ahrefs.com\">ahrefs</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

It is very convenient when communicating between multiple processes, creating a REST API or consuming JSON objects from other tools. It can be compared to <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\">JSON schema</a> or <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/\">Protocol Buffers</a>, but with richer types and more features.</p><p>The idea is to write a list of types in a specification file, an\194\160.atd file. Then running atdgen, it is possible to generate OCaml or Java code to serialize/deserialize values of those types to/from corresponding json.</p><p>Until very recently, atdgen could generate code only for native OCaml. But <a href=\"https://github.com/mjambon/atd/pull/44\">the support of bucklescript has been merged</a>! atdgen the cli tool is still a native OCaml binary. But it can output some OCaml code that can be compiled using <a href=\"https://bucklescript.github.io/\">bucklescript</a>.</p><p>The work to implement this new feature of atdgen has been funded by <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a>. We highly appreciate open source tools. And as much as possible, we prefer to contribute to existing open source projects rather than to re-invent the wheel internally.</p><h3>Installation</h3><p>To install atdgen we first need to install <a href=\"https://opam.ocaml.org\">opam</a> (OCaml package manager), as atdgen doesn\226\128\153t provide ready to use binaries and is only distributed as source package via opam. The procedure is simple and documented here: <a href=\"https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/2.0/Install.html\">https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/2.0/Install.html</a></p><p>Then we need to initialize opam and create a switch. Any version of ocaml greater or equal to 4.03.0 should be\194\160fine.</p><pre>opam init -a<br>opam switch create . 4.07.1 -y</pre><p>Once it is done, we have to install the development version of atdgen. The support of bucklescript is not officially released.</p><pre>opam pin add atd --dev-repo   <br>opam pin add atdgen --dev-repo</pre><p>Make sure that atdgen is available.</p><pre>$ which atdgen                 <br>(current $PWD)/_opam/bin/atdgen</pre><p>Of course, we need bucklescript.</p><pre>yarn init                 <br>yarn add bs-platform --dev</pre><p>We also need the bucklescript runtime for atdgen, as it is not currently provided by atdgen itself. So we have written and open-sourced our version of the runtime\194\160: <a href=\"https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-atdgen-codec-runtime\">https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-atdgen-codec-runtime</a>.</p><p>This runtime is responsible for the conversion between JSON values and OCaml values. The JSON values are based on the standard <a href=\"https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js.Json.html#TYPEt\">Js.Json.t type</a> provided by bucklescript to be sure that it is easy to interoperate with the rest of the ecosystem.</p><p>It is published on npm for easy integration in bucklescript projects.</p><pre>yarn add @ahrefs/bs-atdgen-codec-runtime</pre><h3>Project configuration</h3><p>After the previous section, package.json should be almost ready. We can add a few scripts to make it more convenient to compile the project. Here is how it should look once completed.</p><pre>{<br>  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;demo-bs-atdgen&quot;,<br>  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,<br>  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;demo of atdgen with bucklescript&quot;,<br>  &quot;scripts&quot;: {<br>    &quot;clean&quot;: &quot;bsb -clean-world&quot;,<br>    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;bsb -make-world&quot;,<br>    &quot;watch&quot;: &quot;bsb -make-world -w&quot;,<br>    &quot;atdgen&quot;: &quot;atdgen -t meetup.atd &amp;&amp; atdgen -bs meetup.atd&quot;<br>  },<br>  &quot;devDependencies&quot;: {<br>    &quot;bs-platform&quot;: &quot;^4.0.5&quot;<br>  },<br>  &quot;peerDependencies&quot;: {<br>    &quot;bs-platform&quot;: &quot;^4.0.5&quot;<br>  },<br>  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {<br>    &quot;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/ahrefs/bs-atdgen-codec-runtime\">@ahrefs/bs-atdgen-codec-runtime</a>&quot;: &quot;^1.0.4&quot;<br>  }<br>}</pre><p>The bucklescript configuration is very simple. We use the basic configuration that can be found in any bucklescript project. Except that we need to add one dependency to bsconfig.json:</p><pre>{<br>  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;demo-bs-atdgen&quot;,<br>  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,<br>  &quot;sources&quot;: {<br>    &quot;dir&quot;: &quot;src&quot;,<br>    &quot;subdirs&quot;: true<br>  },<br>  &quot;package-specs&quot;: {<br>    &quot;module&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot;,<br>    &quot;in-source&quot;: true<br>  },<br>  &quot;suffix&quot;: &quot;.bs.js&quot;,<br>  &quot;bs-dependencies&quot;: [<br>    &quot;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/ahrefs/bs-atdgen-codec-runtime\">@ahrefs/bs-atdgen-codec-runtime</a>&quot;<br>  ],<br>  &quot;warnings&quot;: {<br>    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;+101&quot;<br>  },<br>  &quot;generate-merlin&quot;: true,<br>  &quot;namespace&quot;: true,<br>  &quot;refmt&quot;: 3<br>}</pre><h3>First ATD definitions</h3><p>It is time to create a first\194\160.atd file, containing our types.

It should also be possible to have some parts of the library that are a different implementation depending on the target, as we want to be able to leverage existing libraries that are working only in one of the\194\160worlds.</p><h3>The build\194\160systems</h3><p>For BuckleScript, there is only one build system: bsb. It is driven by a bsconfig.json file. And is installed as part of the bs-platform.</p><p>On the native side, there are a lot of different build systems that are available. But recently one of them became a de facto standard: dune. It works with a very minimal amount of configuration. And it supports the reason syntax by\194\160default.</p><p>These two tools are working in a way which is pretty similar. They share a lot of concepts. And it is easy to set them up so that both are working in the same codebase.</p><p>The main similarities that interest us\194\160are:</p><ul><li>The ability to work on specific source directories</li><li>Namespacing in bsb and wrapping in dune are both putting all the<br>files of the library under a single module\194\160name</li></ul><h3>The source code file\194\160tree</h3><p>The code of the library is split into 3 directories.</p><pre>\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 js/<br>\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 native/<br>\226\148\148\226\148\128\226\148\128 shared/</pre><ul><li>shared is meant to host most of the code and all the code in this directory will be compiled in both\194\160modes.</li><li>js contains the parts that are specific to BuckleScript.</li><li>native contains the parts that are specific to native\194\160OCaml.</li></ul><h3>Set up the build\194\160systems</h3><p>Once we have our basic skeleton for the library, it is time to set up the build systems. We want to have two configurations as similar as possible to make them easier to understand. Once we are done, the tree will look like\194\160this:</p><pre>\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 bsconfig.json<br>\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 dune<br>\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 dune-project<br>\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 js/<br>\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 native/<br>\226\148\148\226\148\128\226\148\128 shared/</pre><h4>BuckleScript</h4><p>At the root of the library we need a bsconfig.json file to drive<br>bsb. The documentation is available at <a href=\"https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/build-configuration](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/build-configuration).\">https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/build-configuration</a>.</p><p>The main part for us is sources. We will use it to tell bsb to look at the js and shared folders. We also want to set namespace to true, which will wrap all your project\226\128\153s files under a common module\194\160name.</p><pre>  &quot;namespace&quot;: true,<br>  &quot;sources&quot;: [<br>    {<br>      &quot;dir&quot;: &quot;js&quot;,<br>      &quot;subdirs&quot;: true<br>    }, {<br>      &quot;dir&quot;: &quot;shared&quot;,<br>      &quot;subdirs&quot;: true<br>    }<br>  ],</pre><p>The rest of the file is as\194\160usual.</p><pre>{<br>  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;sharedlib&quot;,<br>  &quot;namespace&quot;: true,<br>  &quot;sources&quot;: [<br>    {<br>      &quot;dir&quot;: &quot;js&quot;,<br>      &quot;subdirs&quot;: true<br>    }, {<br>      &quot;dir&quot;: &quot;shared&quot;,<br>      &quot;subdirs&quot;: true<br>    }<br>  ],<br>  &quot;package-specs&quot;: {<br>    &quot;module&quot;: &quot;es6&quot;,<br>    &quot;in-source&quot;: true<br>  },<br>  &quot;refmt&quot;: 3,<br>  &quot;suffix&quot;: &quot;.bs.js&quot;,<br>  &quot;generate-merlin&quot;: true,<br>}</pre><h4>Dune</h4><p>We must also add a dune file to the root of the library. For dune, we have different options\226\128\138\226\128\148\226\128\138it is possible to ignore the js directory but read everything else. Or to check only shared and native. To make the configuration similar to BuckleScript, we will go with the second solution.</p><p>The dune directive to do that is dirs. By defaults it tells dune to explore every directory except the ones hidden (starting with a dot) or starting with an underscore. <a href=\"https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#dirs-since-1-6\">More details in dune\226\128\153s documentation</a>. To make it do what we want, the configuration should\194\160be:</p><pre>(dirs shared native)</pre><p>We also use another option of dune to tell it to include the content of those two directories as if it was at the root of the project. Without this stanza, dune would only use the source files at the root of the project and ignore everything in the sub directories.</p><pre>(include_subdirs unqualified)</pre><p>Then we need the usual library stanza to give a name to our library, state the dependencies, compilation flags, etc. In our simple case, the only information needed is the name. We can explicitly set wrapped to true, but this is already the default behavior. The <a href=\"https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#library\">documentation for the whole library stanza</a> describes how to specify more\194\160details.</p><p>The final dune file looks like\194\160this:</p><pre>(dirs shared native)<br> (include_subdirs unqualified)<br> (library<br>  (name sharedlib))</pre><p>We also want a basic dune-project. If we don\226\128\153t write it by hand, dune will generate it for us. I am using version 1.10 as an example. But it can be changed to whatever version suits your\194\160project.</p><pre>(lang dune 1.10)</pre><h3>Compilation</h3><p>With the setup described above, the compilation for BuckleScript and native is the same as in a setup with only one or the\194\160other.</p><ul><li>bsb -make-world for BuckleScript</li><li>dune build @all for\194\160dune</li></ul><p>The call to bsb is usally put in package.json in the scripts part, so that the usual yarn build can be used. For native, it depends if you rely on esy or\194\160opam.</p><h3>How to consume the\194\160library</h3><p>This is exactly the same setup that would be used in a pure BuckleScript or pure native\194\160library.</p><p>To use your library in BuckleScript:</p><ul><li>Add the name and version to package.json</li><li>Add the name to bsbconfig.json of consuming library/app</li></ul><p>To use your library in native OCaml, add the name of your library to the libraries part an executable or library stanza,\194\160e.g.</p><pre>(executable<br> (name main)<br> (libraries sharedlib))</pre><h3>Module naming</h3><p>If you want your module name to contain capital letters in the middle (e.g. TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles), then be aware that <a href=\"https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/build-configuration.html#name-namespace\">name munging</a> works differently between bsbconfig.json and dune. For example, if you want to refer to your module as CoolSharedLib in your code, then the name in bsbconfig.json must be cool-shared-lib, and in dune it must be coolSharedLib.</p><h3>Platform specific\194\160code</h3><p>The whole library does not have to be exactly the same in the two platform. It is possible to add modules that are available only in one mode. Or to have modules with a different interface.</p><p>For example, by adding a file Foo.re in js but not in native, the library now has a module Foo available when compiled to javascript. But only when compiled to javascript.</p><h3>Downsides</h3><ul><li>Both bsb and dune generate\194\160.merlin files when they compile our library. They override each other. It might be troublesome if the version of ocaml used for native code is not 4.02.3. Simply recompile the library for your platform to solve the\194\160problem.</li><li>Out of the box, this approach doesn\226\128\153t really allow us to share interface files between both platforms: native and BuckleScript. One workaround for that, if we wanted to share some module Foo, is to:<br>1. add Foo.mli or Foo.rei file in shared<br>2. add include FooImplementation in Foo.ml<br>3. add FooImplementation in both native and js\194\160folder</li><li>It\226\128\153s not possible to be platform specific for just a few lines of code (e.g. if IS_NATIVE foo else bar), the minimal per-platform unit is a file/module.</li></ul><h3>Example project</h3><p>We have set up a simple library to showcase what a repository looks like once the whole configuration is in place. It is <a href=\"https://github.com/ahrefs/hello-native-bucklescript\">available on\194\160github</a>.</p><p>For now the repository contains only a library. But with this setup, it is actually possible to build an executable too. It is also possible to enrich it, for example by adding <a href=\"https://tech.ahrefs.com/getting-started-with-atdgen-and-bucklescript-1f3a14004081\">atdgen to communicate between both sides of the\194\160library</a>.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=22f45e5e946d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://tech.ahrefs.com/how-to-write-a-library-for-bucklescript-and-native-22f45e5e946d\">How to write a library for BuckleScript and Native</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://tech.ahrefs.com\">ahrefs</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

Since then, many more applications have been either rewritten in Reason, are being slowly migrated from React to ReasonReact, or are conceived from the start as Reason projects. It is safe to say that the bet placed on Reason paid off big time. We will never go back to doing pure JavaScript again, with the possible exception of simple backend\194\160scripts.</p><p>In the past few years, it\226\128\153s come to light that there are a number of other <a href=\"https://www.messenger.com/\">large</a> <a href=\"https://www.onegraph.com/\">Reason</a>/<a href=\"https://darklang.com/\">BuckleScript</a> <a href=\"https://onivim.io/\">codebases</a> in the wild, but there still isn\226\128\153t a ton of information out there about what it\226\128\153s really like to work with Reason in production. To help remedy that, we thought it would be instructive to ask each of our frontend team members what their Reason journey has been like so\194\160far.</p><p>We gave them the following questions as starting points (but they were free to talk about anything they\194\160wanted):</p><ul><li>How does Reason compare to other languages you\226\128\153ve used in the\194\160past?</li><li>What\226\128\153s your favorite thing about\194\160Reason?</li><li>What\226\128\153s your least favorite thing about\194\160Reason?</li><li>How does ReasonReact compare to other frameworks you\226\128\153ve\194\160used?</li><li>Was it easy to pick up Reason? Why or why\194\160not?</li></ul><h4>Javi</h4><ul><li>How does Reason compare to other languages you\226\128\153ve used in the\194\160past?</li></ul><p>In the past I worked with languages like Java, C, or less known like Pascal or Prolog. But the languages I\226\128\153ve spent more time with are Objective-C and JavaScript. The main difference between all those languages and Reason is the exhaustiveness that you get from OCaml type checker. This is maybe awkward, but it feels like you stop coding alone and suddenly you have a sidekick always sitting next to you, that is helping you notice the things you forgot about, or found new code that is not consistent with code you or someone else wrote\194\160before.</p><p>In a world that is moving towards remote work, where many of us spend hours every day coding physically far from our colleagues, it makes the experience much more delightful. Plus, it allows for teams working on different time zones to keep a healthier work-life balance, because there is less need to have synchronous communication than with more dynamic languages, as more assumptions and design decisions are \226\128\156embedded\226\128\157 into the\194\160code.</p><ul><li>What\226\128\153s your favorite thing about\194\160Reason?</li></ul><p>Can I pick two things? It\226\128\153s hard to choose only\194\160one.</p><p>The first one is the exhaustiveness and quality of the type checker, as mentioned above. Sometimes it takes a bit longer to build a feature than what it would in other languages, until the types are figured out. But this is largely compensated by the confidence one has when shipping code to production, or diving into large refactors.</p><p>The second one is the speed of the BuckleScript build system, which is built on top of <a href=\"https://ninja-build.org/\">ninja</a>. I had never worked with such fast build system. As an example, we have recently started to use remote machines to develop at Ahrefs. In one of these machines that has 72 cores, BuckleScript takes roughly 3 seconds to clean build <em>all</em> our Reason code: application, libs, decoders\226\128\166 everything. Many tens of thousand lines of code! We thought there were something wrong, but we realized the compiler is just So Blazing\194\160Fast\226\132\162\239\184\143.</p><ul><li>What\226\128\153s your least favorite thing about\194\160Reason?</li></ul><p>I guess we\226\128\153re going through a necessary stage until things stabilize in the future, but there is a lot of fragmentation at the moment between \226\128\156Reason native\226\128\157, which tries to stay closer to OCaml, and \226\128\156Reason web\226\128\157, which has a goal to become friendlier for JavaScript developers.</p><p>I am excited to see what <a href=\"https://reasonml.org/blog/bucklescript-8-1-new-syntax\">BuckleScript new syntax</a> will lead to, but I would also love to see a \226\128\156universal\226\128\157 solution that works for the main use cases out of the box, becoming sort of Rails for Ocaml or Reason. <a href=\"https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl/\">sihl</a> is a project that seems to go in that direction and looks very promising.</p><ul><li>How does ReasonReact compare to other frameworks you\226\128\153ve\194\160used?</li></ul><p>I consider ReasonReact mostly like React + types on top, because the bindings layer is very thin. The thing that I like most about React is that it follows the Unix philosophy: it does one thing and it does it really well. Maybe we have forgotten already today, but having to maintain and mutate UI based on data updates was one of the main sources of bugs in the past. The other nice thing is that there is so much good content about it: blog posts, documentation, etc.</p><ul><li>Was it easy to pick up Reason? Why or why\194\160not?</li></ul><p>It took some time, as with any other language. We have things like syntax or semantics much more ingrained into our brains than we think, so there is always some \226\128\156rewiring\226\128\157 time that is needed to learn a new language, even if Reason makes an effort to stay close to JavaScript syntax. The most challenging part was probably the bindings one, because coming from JavaScript, there are no previous knowledge that one can use as foundation to build upon, it\226\128\153s all \226\128\156new knowledge\226\128\157. glennsl <a href=\"https://github.com/glennsl/bucklescript-ffi-cheatsheet\">BuckleScript ffi cheatsheet</a> was a huge help for\194\160me.</p><h4>Ze</h4><p>I really like working with Reason, and have wanted to do so for a while. I was quite happy to see that working with it matched my expectations.</p><p>You get so much support from the type system, and still have a lot of flexibility to represent your domain model. Coming from other languages or paradigms, you don\226\128\153t feel limited at all in what you can\194\160achieve.</p><p>The language has such a strong type system that you feel much more comfortable with your\194\160coding.</p><p>The OCaml type system is there to make sure you code with assurance. This is especially true when refactoring code. You can be sure that everything will work fine after it compiles. If it compiles, it works\194\160:)</p><p>It\226\128\153s also very helpful when working on a monorepo. You don\226\128\153t have to keep reading the source code of everything you use to make sure you don\226\128\153t have types mistakes. Changes in code in one lib reflect immediately in all the others. This makes the feedback loop much shorter and\194\160safer.</p><p>The editors integrations with the type system are quite good and help a lot to write code better and\194\160faster.</p><p>Also, compilation times are super\194\160fast.</p><p>Last, but not least, ReasonReact is, for me, the hidden gem of ReasonML. The newcomers that have some difficulty with the language should start with it. IMHO, ReasonReact is simpler and has a better developer experience than React itself. It should be the gateway drug frontend developers need to get started with Reason/OCaml \240\159\152\132</p><h4>Liubomyr</h4><p>To me, all those language features boil down to one essential thing, and it\226\128\153s the easiness of refactoring. New business requirements popups all the time, and often your initial code assumptions are no longer correct. It was such a pain to modify code in a large JS codebase, as you never know how many things you potentially break in the process. With Reason, it has never been easier. If you need to change your data shape or some component API, you just do it, and from there, the compiler will guide you through all the places you broke, and help to fix\194\160those.</p><p>Coming from the JS world, it feels like the initial development is slower, because of the learning curve, missing bindings, less StackOverflow answers, but in the end, you are getting a stable software which is way easier to maintain and add features\194\160to.</p><h4>Egor</h4><p>I switched to Reason when I joined Ahrefs team about a year ago, before that I worked mostly with Ruby language.</p><p>The first thing that impressed me in ReasonML was code refactoring. Refactoring in language with a strong type system, like ReasonML and OCaml, is much easier than what I am used to. If your program compiles after your refactoring\226\128\138\226\128\148\226\128\138most likely you did everything right, if it doesn\226\128\153t compile\226\128\138\226\128\148\226\128\138you can immediately see what you forgot to change. This can be achieved in languages with a dynamic type system only with a huge amount of code tests (supporting big test suite is a time consuming process as well as code support).</p><p>The other thing that I really like about ReasonML codebase\226\128\138\226\128\148\226\128\138how readable it is. When you just enter into ReasonML world\226\128\138\226\128\148\226\128\138some things can be unfriendly from the first sight, for example, immutable let bindings, but in the end, you realize that these language decisions help you to write cleaner and simpler\194\160code.</p><h4>Seif</h4><p>The programming language I used the most in the past is JavaScript. I switched to Reason when I joined Ahrefs a few months ago. From the start, I worked mainly on the code shared by the majority of the tools and I don\226\128\153t think I would have had the same confidence making changes if I was doing it with JavaScript. I love JavaScript\226\128\153s developer experience and accessibility. Reason provided me predictability without hurting these very same things I like about JavaScript.</p><h4>Bryan</h4><p>Reason (and OCaml) is, by far, one of the easiest languages to work with. Easy in the sense that the compiler helps eliminate an entire class of errors so you don\226\128\153t have to worry about them. Additionally, in most other web-centric languages, it\226\128\153s a pain to add features to existing code that you\226\128\153ve not touched for a long time. With strong static typing, I can usually add the feature I want in either the backend or frontend, and then let the compiler tell me what needs to be\194\160updated.</p><p>Pattern-matching is one of my favourite features in Reason. To me, it makes more sense to be able to explicitly specify conditions that I\226\128\153m interested in a clear and concise manner, and let the compiler tell me if I missed out a particular condition. Records go hand-in-hand with this. As software programs are made up of data and instructions, records are the perfect data containers. They are quick to define and query, focusing on data rather than behaviour (think classes and instance methods).</p><p>It definitely took a while to pick up Reason mainly because it takes time to become familiar with idiomatic OCaml. But once I crested that learning curve, everything just made sense and all the features of the language that made Reason seemingly difficult to learn\226\128\138\226\128\148\226\128\138strong typing, the functional paradigm, etc, became assistants that helped me to write better\194\160code.</p><h4>Feihong</h4><p><a href=\"https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/\">ReasonReact</a> is a great library for making complex UIs in a large codebase because you get the familiarity of React coupled with the type safety of OCaml. Having two well-established technologies in its foundation is a big advantage that ReasonReact has over other functional UI libraries/frameworks in the transpile-to-JS universe. I didn\226\128\153t have any professional OCaml experience before joining, yet the ramp up was made much easier by my existing knowledge of React and the (somewhat superficial) similarity of the Reason syntax to JS. Oftentimes it was possible to correctly guess the intent of existing Reason code without knowing all the syntax, because most React concepts carry over pretty directly. And even though the documentation is incomplete and not perfect, it\226\128\153s quite usable already and among conceptually-similar frameworks is second only to the Elm documentation.</p><p>The compiler errors were difficult to get used to at first. The compiler is fairly good at pointing out the location of the error, but not necessarily as good at explaining the nature or cause of the error. As such, having a REPL would be extremely useful. Actually, OCaml does have its own REPL, but BuckleScript (the compiler used by Reason to translate OCaml to JS) does not at the moment. Nonetheless, the <a href=\"https://reasonml.github.io/en/try\">Try Reason</a> page is a really good tool to try out small snippets of code and is extremely useful while learning the language (we will still occasionally post Try Reason links in our slack channel).</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>The reality is that Ahrefs has always been an OCaml shop, but in the past OCaml was only used to build the backend. Now that we are also using it on the frontend, we get the benefits that our backend colleagues have enjoyed for many years: the expressiveness afforded by pattern matching, the ease of refactoring in large codebases, the stability of a mature programming language, and the confidence of \226\128\156if it compiles, it works\226\128\157. To make a shoddy nautical analogy, it is as if we had built a wooden ship powered by a turbo engine. But now the wooden parts are being replaced with steel and plastic, bringing the exterior of the ship up to modern standards as well. As a result, the ship runs faster and more reliably, making the passengers (our users) more satisfied. Also, pirates (bugs) have a harder time hijacking the ship because it\226\128\153s sturdier and defended by well-disciplined camels. Because the ship keeps getting more and more passengers who want to experience a delightful ride and take pictures with enigmatic camels, we require a constant influx of willing and able boat engineers (who aren\226\128\153t allergic to camels) to extend and maintain the ship. (Yes, that means that <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/jobs\">we are hiring</a>\239\184\143.)</p><p><em>Thanks to Raman and Louis for fact checking this\194\160post.</em></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2250cf5ba63b\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://tech.ahrefs.com/one-and-a-half-years-of-reasonml-in-production-2250cf5ba63b\">One and a half years of ReasonML in production</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://tech.ahrefs.com\">ahrefs</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

At this scale, dealing with unexpected application behaviors is common. While we try to reduce the probability of the software not functioning as expected, bugs are sadly a real part of our everyday life. Even though we can assume the underlying hardware running any infrastructure can be thought of as more reliable and less prone to bugs than software components, issues can still arise in unexpected ways. When the number of servers increases, it is not unusual to observe faults in the hardware preventing the system from functioning as specified.</p><p>It is certainly not frequent to encounter such problems in CPUs but reading through <a href=\"https://www3.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/specification-updates/desktop-6th-gen-core-family-spec-update.pdf\">the list of errata published by any manufacturer,</a> each CPU model contains a fair amount of bugs. This story is about the bug in the microcode of Skylake processor leading to incorrect code execution under certain conditions. This is certainly scary at first sight: how can we trust our system if we cannot trust its main component\194\160? Yet, like software bugs, processor defects can be identified, contained, and we can take actions to prevent them from impacting the operation of the infrastructure.</p><p>We do not know the full implications of this particular bug, especially security implications in case of untrusted code execution. But we\226\128\153d like to tell the story of this erratum from our point of view, to provide some context, and show that dealing with it was not much different than dealing with any usual software flaw. While this post aims to cover our own perspective on this adventure, we would like to thank Mark Shinwell, Xavier Leroy, Fr\195\169d\195\169ric Bour, everyone involved in the <a href=\"https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=7452\">Mantis issue</a> and the OCaml IRC channel for their help and time spent investigating with us. Update: Xavier Leroy told his own side of the story in another <a href=\"http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/intel-skylake-bug/\">blog\194\160post.</a></p><h3>Setting the\194\160scene</h3><p>Our story starts in late 2016 after some of our backend developers received new laptops to work on. After a few days Enguerrand Decorne noticed unusual crashes during compilation of our OCaml codebase.</p><p>This issue, considered mildly annoying at first, seemed to affect only Enguerrand\226\128\153s machine. For a few days no other machine would exhibit the same behavior, so we figured this was a fault specific to his system configuration.</p><p>However, concerns were subsequently raised after witnessing the generation of invalid machine code and later on, after the deployment of a service on one of our new clusters composed of Skylake Xeon processors, leading to the insertion of corrupted data into our storage system. The priority raised from the annoying level, to potentially critical. Other developers started working together to obtain more information and assess the impact on our infrastructure. Soon after we were able to reproduce the issue on several machines.</p><p>The remainder of this post is a technical description of the steps taken to ensure that our systems were operating safely. It is intended to show that such low level CPU issues is not necessarily fatal\226\128\138\226\128\148\226\128\138in less than two weeks, with the great help of core OCaml developers, we identified the conditions of the crash and set up a workaround.</p><h3>Tracking down crashes in\194\160OCaml</h3><p>Most of our backend code is written in <a href=\"https://ocaml.org\">OCaml</a>, a high level and expressive language supporting functional programming style (among others), which allows us to develop robust systems with ease, thanks to its strong type system and mature\194\160legacy.</p><p>The compiler segfaults were definitely a surprise, since this shouldn\226\128\153t happen for any program written in OCaml, as type system and other features (such as automatic bounds-checking) usually guard us from such errors. However, stack overflows can be possible sources of segfault (when a non-optimal recursion is running too deep), so our first intuition was to increase the stack size when running the compiler. This didn\226\128\153t change anything, and the reported fault address wasn\226\128\153t anywhere near the stack address\194\160bound.</p><p>Before witnessing the crash on other machines, we suspected a failure in the virtualization software used by our two developers that were able to reproduce the crash, who use VMware as a part of their development workflow. We tried early on to switch to Virtualbox, but the migration proved itself fruitless as the crashes kept appearing. After a short while we began encountering the same issue on physical machines, so we ruled out a possible virtualization software\194\160bug.</p><p>The usual debugging process for crashing OCaml code didn\226\128\153t prove effective\226\128\138\226\128\148\226\128\138we needed to narrow down our approach.</p><p>OCaml ships with <a href=\"https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/the-compiler-backend-byte-code-and-native-code.html\">two backend implementations</a>: a bytecode interpreter and a native compiler. We were able to reproduce the issue using both a native compiler and a compiler running on the bytecode interpreter. Consequently, this ruled out a miscompilation coming from the code <em>emitted</em> by the compiler, the OCaml runtime <em>itself</em> was misbehaving.</p><p>The runtime code is written in C, and implements low level functionalities, including the garbage collector used by both backends. After rebuilding the runtime with debug symbols, we were able to retrieve a proper stack trace and core dump. The stack trace pointed to the garbage collector\226\128\153s mark phase. OCaml\226\128\153s GC is a classic generational mark and sweep collector. The mark phase walks the heap starting from pointers on the stack and other registered root values, and marks every reachable block of\194\160memory.</p><p>Further inspection with <strong><em>gdb</em></strong> of the frame and address of crash revealed that the marking code encountered a corrupted block header with invalid size information, causing what looked like a buffer overrun error. Each memory block allocated in OCaml heap begins with a header word, storing metadata used by the GC, including a tag describing the kind of value present in this memory block. The header contains the size of the block, and the crash happened when the mark code was attempting to scan an array which was supposed to be more than 1TB\194\160large.</p><p>This was obviously not the cause of the problem but rather the consequence: something corrupted the header word after this block had been properly allocated, postponing the crash until the next GC cycle. It was the right time to escalate <a href=\"https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=7452\">the issue to the OCaml bugtracker</a>, after isolating a proper test case to reproduce the\194\160issue.</p><h3>A set of strange\194\160leads</h3><p>Escalating the issue to Mantis made us to take a step back and gather our findings, and we quickly got great feedback from the OCaml core\194\160team.</p><p>At this point, what does the problem look\194\160like?</p><p>We only had sparse information, but <strong><em>dmesg</em></strong> gave us interesting data point. When a page fault occurs and the kernel detects an incorrect memory access, it logs a line in kernel log buffer containing the fault address, the instruction pointer and stack\194\160pointer.</p><p>[22985.879907] ocamlopt.opt[48221]: segfault at af8 ip 00005564455169bd sp 00007ffc9f36b130 error 4 in ocamlopt.opt[556445006000+613000]</p><p>Next to the 3 addresses, already available in the coredumps, an error code is reported. This number in decimal form is actually a bitset, and the flags are documented in the Linux kernel sources in <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.11/arch/x86/mm/fault.c#L41\">arch/x86/mm/fault.c</a>. Error 4 can thus be read as a read access page fault from user mode, trying to read memory which had not been previously mmap\226\128\153ed.</p><p>Error codes reported following our crashes involved protection faults or access to unmapped addresses, which corroborated our earlier buffer overrun hypothesis. More interestingly we witnessed a crash with the PF_RSVD flag enabled. This left us puzzled, none of us had ever seen such fault before. Apparently it indicates that the the page table was somehow corrupted, with some entries having non-zero bits reserved by the x86 architecture specification.</p><p>It was scary that the corruption would escape the process address space, and to our limited knowledge, it could only have been caused by kernel issue or potentially hardware issues, like memory errors. Yet we were able to reproduce this on several machines with different kernel version, and different hardware. We blamed virtual machines earlier but this theory was debunked already. We still have no explanation at this time, and pursuit on this front would require intimate knowledge of virtual memory implementations that we didn\226\128\153t\194\160have.</p><p>One developer wasn\226\128\153t able to reproduce the problem at all on his machine after hours of testing, but something was fishy: it didn\226\128\153t sound right that an OCaml runtime bug would be able to modify the page table. Maybe it was some corner case with reserved addresses, but this something was beyond our reach here. Out of ideas, it was time to get some assistance from tools intended to track memory corruptions, like <a href=\"https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer\">asan and\194\160ubsan</a>.</p><p>Running <strong><em>Asan</em></strong> didn\226\128\153t yield any meaningful results. <strong><em>Valgrind</em></strong> was later tried, following advises from the OCaml team, but every tools were preventing the crash. Quickly reproducing the bug for testing required running code in a loop, keeping the CPU and memory fully\194\160busy.</p><p>This was harder to do on developers machines, due to limited resources and other processes running, and Address Sanitizer would only increase the resources usage. Dedicating a powerful server would make further investigations more comfortable, and increase the likeliness of reproducing with instrumented code.</p><p>But with great surprise, it was not possible to reproduce the problem on a server machine, with and without instrumented code. This is when we realised that all the machines exhibiting the crashes were running a processor of the Intel Skylake processors family, while the server and other developer machines had CPUs from the Broadwell family.</p><h3>The hardware, an unusual\194\160suspect</h3><p>In the meantime several core OCaml developers had been closely investigating the issue and started auditing recent changes in the runtime, and identified a few suspicious changes and known\194\160bugs.</p><p>Certainly they were more qualified for this task, but it acted as an incentive to examine the history of this bug from our angle. At first, we had assumed that the bug was specific to the new laptop with virtual machines. This could not explain why the crash never manifested on older workstations equipped with Skylake processors. Several other developers had been using them for a few months, and only noticed the crash after awareness of the issue had been raised by Enguerrand.</p><p>What had changed, besides Skylake? Only a few week before, an internal migration from OCaml version 4.02.3 to 4.03.0 was rolled out in our codebase. Intrigued, we went ahead and tested OCaml 4.02.3 again, which showed no memory corruptions after several tests. It was time to browse the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/ocaml/trunk/Changes\">OCaml changelog</a> for runtime related entries. The search stopped quickly on a promising item in the list: the OCaml C runtime build optimisation level had been increased to -O2 from\194\160-O1.</p><p>Could the optimizations dig out an undefined behavior in C code, leading to bad assumptions in the GC code corrupting the heap\194\160? Rebuilding the runtime with -O1did not corrupt memory, so the source of the corruption was in the runtime <em>and</em> was triggered by some gcc specific optimization pass. This sounded like undefined behavior, although the information we had led us to some hardware\194\160bug.</p><p>The next day, Xavier Leroy commented on the bugreport reporting that the crash had been observed in the past. Another industrial OCaml user was affected, and they had discovered HyperThreading was part of the necessary conditions. After running the test case for several hours on several machines with HT disabled in the UEFI setup, it was clear we were facing a similar situation. This led to the hypothesis of a hardware\194\160bug:</p><blockquote><em>Is it crazy to imagine that gcc -O2 on the OCaml 4.03 runtime produces a specific instruction sequence that causes hardware issues in (some steppings of) Skylake processors with hyperthreading? Perhaps it is\194\160crazy.</em></blockquote><p>This possibility had struck us too, motivated by the HyperThreading, the page table corruption and the Skylake specific set of conditions.</p><p>This issue had certainly a strange profile. But nobody was ready to fully embrace the cpu bug hypothesis yet. We convinced ourselves that disabling HT could affect cache pressure and unfold some undefined behaviours.</p><p>HT could also explain the non-determinism, since cache pressure would depend on timings and scheduling. None of us had sufficient experience in this area to assess the strength of such hypothesis, and we did not quite buy it on a single threaded OCaml program. Our debugging motto claims that \226\128\156assumptions are not\194\160facts\226\128\157.</p><p>It was time to browse Intel errata list and attempt to update the CPU microcode. Although, the errata descriptions are formulated in vague terms, none of the issues disclosed at this time were looking similar to the situation under investigation. Unfortunately, CPUs microcode had no fix waiting for us either. OCaml developers investigated the errata list from their side but the lack of detailed information turned this into a fruitless and complex\194\160task.</p><p>In the absence of better alternative, we focused our work on pinpointing the exact source of the crash as if it was a software bug, in the hope of either finding a code issue or ruling out this hypothesis while getting more detailed data. We needed a way to identify the problematic code and find a workaround. From our side, it was not only a matter of finding whether or not there was a bug in OCaml code, but more crucially we needed a guarantee on the quality of our generated code running critical services in production.</p><h3>Identifying the offending code</h3><p>The other OCaml user affected by this issue reported that they had solved the problem by switching to another C compiler. Building the runtime with clang instead of GCC would prevent the GC from crashing. They also suggested to obtain a diff of the generated assembly. Indeed, once built with clang, the runtime would not crash. But clang generates widely different assembly from GCC and we did not have the resources to analyse several hundred thousand lines of\194\160changes.</p><p>If we could isolate the problematic C code, comparing the generated code would be easier. The problem had the form of a well known\194\160nail:</p><ul><li>Around 50 C files composing the OCaml\194\160runtime,</li><li>There is a good state (when built with gcc\194\160-O1)</li><li>And a bad state (when built with gcc\194\160-O2)</li></ul><p>This nail comes with a precious hammer: bisection.</p><p>The bisection approach had a downside in this occasion. Any state can be labeled bad with certainty as soon as the test crashes, but we would need to wait several hours to be confident enough to trust a non crashing test as good data-point. The reproducibility was not always consistent and a non-crashing state could be a false negative still waiting to trigger the conditions leading to the crash. A reduction of search space was necessary.</p><p>All the coredumps we had showed that the fault was caused by a corrupted heap block header, and our testcase involved the compiler. The OCaml compiler is not 100% deterministic, and IO/s primitives and unix environment in the runtime can affect timings and allocation patterns. But it sounded sensible to assume that the code corrupting a heap header block was also the code reading and writing those blocks: the major\194\160GC.</p><p>This hypothesis made bisecting fast: the first file we tried, <strong><em>major_gc.c</em></strong>, turned out to be the one. To make sure it was not a subtle issue in linker, reordering symbols or code blocks, we tried a few others files and confirmed changing the optimization level of some other files alone made no difference.</p><p>But the generated code difference was still way too large. Bringing this topic up on the <a href=\"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#ocaml\">OCaml IRC</a> discussion channel led to some useful inputs. We were taught that gcc supports an attribute to enable specific optimizations at the function level, using __attribute__((optimize(&quot;options,...&quot;))). Following the same strategy, it was easy to trace the source of the malfunctioning code to the <strong><em>sweep_slice</em></strong> function, which implements the sweeping phase of the classic mark and sweep garbage collector for the old generation.</p><p>Ignoring the subtle details of incremental GC, the <strong><em>sweep_slice</em></strong> function is the last pass of a normal major collection cycle. It is responsible for scanning all blocks in the major heap, and reclaiming unreachable blocks to the list of unallocated space.</p><p>The bulk of this function is a switch taking action for each block depending on its status\194\160:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/cfbc19fddccc5f2c1a76fcc802fae049/href\">https://medium.com/media/cfbc19fddccc5f2c1a76fcc802fae049/href</a></iframe><p>This finding felt consistent with the information at hand. When the block is reachable, the color (describing the reachability status of the block) is reset. If the block became unreachable (<em>while color</em>) - it is reclaimed. In both cases, the block header is modified.</p><p>Getting back to the assembly\194\160diff.</p><p>Nobody in the team knows a great deal about assembly and we only have a really basic understanding of most of the instructions used in both versions. It quickly became obvious that the noise level in this diff, with thousands of lines of changed, was still too high for us to spot anything related to the problem. This problem was getting far beyond the common knowledge of everyone in the\194\160team.</p><p>But this was still sounding like your day to day bug tracking process. The less you know, the more careful you need to be, tackling the problem step by step. We stuck to what approach had served us well until now: bisecting.</p><p>We went through the list of optimisation passes enabled by GCC at -O2. This is a fair amount of optimisation passes and it would have been too time consuming to try them one by one, given the time needed to trigger the crash. Yet we had a hint: a memory corruption was happening semi randomly in the garbage collector. We were also keeping the undefined behaviour bug as a potential explanation. It was likely a pass which would change the structure of the code, reordering blocks and changing conditions.</p><p>After reading the description of all switches in the detailed gcc manual, the -ftree-* pass family looked promising. This set of transformations works on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form\">SSA form</a> internal representation, a widespread intermediate language representation which has the benefit of being easy to read. They seem to make a huge impact on the generated assembly code, moving code blocks around and making assumptions on code invariants in order to move around, simplify or eliminate conditional checks altogether.</p><p>By looking at output of those passes on the related source code, we narrowed down the list of transformations to a couple of interesting passes, one of them being -ftree-vrp, which stands for Value Range Propagation. This pass computes bounds for each name binding and propagates proofs that a value must lie in a given\194\160range.</p><p>It turned out most of the other passes depended on it for further optimisations. Even though the issue ended up not being a bad assumptions in the range values, checking this pass proved to be worthwhile: enabling -ftree-vrp on <strong><em>sweep_slice</em></strong> function while every thing else was built with -O1 was enough to trigger a\194\160crash.</p><p>GCC provides very good diagnostics output, and after reading the manual we found the -fdump-tree-* switch to dump the SSA form before and after specific pass. The output is designed to be read by a human and provides meaningful naming, with source code locations, alongside the ranges propagated by the VRP pass. We spent some time studying the output and matched the difference in SSA tree between the crashing and not crashing\194\160code.</p><p>Examining the bounds and invariants derived by gcc, it was clear that no wrong hypothesis was\194\160stated.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/a5a311d0b5a4f890f9541f0aed91e73e/href\">https://medium.com/media/a5a311d0b5a4f890f9541f0aed91e73e/href</a></iframe><p>The only meaningful observable change involves the suppression of rechecking the loop condition in the else branch of the <strong><em>sweep_slice</em></strong> function, after Value Range Propagation proved that the condition was invariant in this\194\160branch.</p><p>Often, reading the code carefully is the fastest way to find a bug. But after spending hours staring at the major GC code, it was clear enough that this check removal should not cause any semantic\194\160changes.</p><p>In this process, we identified a suspicious bit of code, where a signed long variable was promoted to unsigned according to C standard rules, which was changing the bounds derived by gcc, assuming it was always positive. But after some thinking we realised it made no difference at assembly level and although wrong, this assumption was not used anywhere.</p><p>We were now ready to rule out the possibility of a bug in OCaml runtime. It was still possible that GCC backend had a bug and was miscompiling this particular shape of code. And we were back at the assembly level again. After writing some awk formatting script to cleanup assembly and minimise noise in the diff (by renaming labels, detecting spurious code move, etc), and preventing inlining, we found a minimal assembly patch causing the\194\160crash.</p><p>There were only cosmetic differences. The test removal was propagated down to assembly and caused gcc to reorganise the layout of each switch case\194\160block.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/532ab4896b11177a96203fd0c81eaa58/href\">https://medium.com/media/532ab4896b11177a96203fd0c81eaa58/href</a></iframe><p>Among those minor differences and changes of layout, we noticed a particular change which impacted exactly the reachable block header updated which could have caused header corruption. In the unoptimised version, the updating code looked like\194\160this:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/38ca30a1decf86233084721c3803b1c4/href\">https://medium.com/media/38ca30a1decf86233084721c3803b1c4/href</a></iframe><p>For some reason, the block pointer was spilled to the\194\160stack.</p><p>Perhaps naively, and because we had earlier emitted the hypothesis of HT impacting cache pressure, we spent a few hours staring at this code and check if we were missing something subtle which could affect the control flow of the whole function and the stack location from which it was reloaded could be corrupted.</p><p>Despite our lack of assembly knowledge, after spending several hours reading this tiny change, we got convinced that it made strictly no semantic difference. Reading the x86 manual carefully didn\226\128\153t give any hint on any subtle behavior which would trigger. Executing any of those two sequence of instruction should give the exact same\194\160output.</p><h3>Mitigating the\194\160issue</h3><p>We were now quite certain it was a CPU\194\160bug.</p><p>The OCaml developers had reached the same conclusion, and were working on escalating the issue to Intel. After internal discussions we decided to keep this bug as low profile as possible since we were unsure about potential security implications, especially for JIT implementations.</p><p>Even if we had no confirmation at this point nor any explanations of the cause of this bug, which was beyond our reach, we could take\194\160actions.</p><p>The first step was to decide against getting any new Skylake based servers until further announcement. We were left with several Skylake machines but we refrained from deploying any OCaml code on them. OCaml comes with a great package manager, <a href=\"https://opam.ocaml.org/\">opam</a>, which supports compiler switches. Switches allow to set up a clean and distinct environment with specific packages and compiler configuration.</p><p>We patched our internal opam repository to distribute unoptimised runtime to all developers and moved forward, waiting for further announcements.</p><p>This situation made us realise that microcode requires constant updates, just like any other software in the stack. We raised awareness on this topic in our devops team, and they took measure to ensure we could roll out updates to prod\194\160easily.</p><h3>Happy end</h3><p>In late May, devops team noticed a <a href=\"http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/non-free/i/intel-microcode/intel-microcode_3.20170511.1_changelog\">debian package update for intel-microcode</a> containing the following change:</p><pre>Likely fix nightmare-level Skylake erratum SKL150.

What makes it so good is that it doesn't just\nblindly send random input to your program hoping for it to crash; it inspects the execution paths\nof the program and uses that information to figure out which mutations to apply to the previous\ninputs to trigger new execution paths. This approach allows for much more efficient and reliable\nfuzzing (as it will try to maximize coverage) but requires the binaries to be instrumented so the\nexecution can be monitored.</p>\n<p>AFL provides wrappers for the common C compilers that you can use to produce the instrumented\nbinaries along with the CLI fuzzing client: <code>afl-fuzz</code>.</p>\n<p><code>afl-fuzz</code> is straight-forward to use. It takes an input directory containing a few initial valid\ninputs to your program, an output directory and the instrumented binary. It will then repeatedly\nmutate the inputs and feed them to the program, registering the ones that lead to crashes or\nhangs in the output directory.</p>\n<p>Because it works in such a way, it makes it very easy to fuzz a parser.</p>\n<p>To fuzz a <code>parse.exe</code> binary, that takes a file as its first command-line argument and parses it,\nyou can invoke <code>afl-fuzz</code> in the following way:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ afl-fuzz -i inputs/ -o findings/ /path/to/parse.exe @@</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>findings/</code> directory is where <code>afl-fuzz</code> will write the crashes it finds, it will create it\nfor you if it doesn't exist.\nThe <code>inputs/</code> directory contains one or more valid input files for your\nprogram. By valid we mean \"that don't crash your program\".\nFinally the <code>@@</code> part tells <code>afl-fuzz</code> where on the command line the input file should be passed to\nyour program, in our case, as the first argument.</p>\n<p>Note that it is possible to supply <code>afl-fuzz</code> with more detail about how to invoke your program. If\nyou need to pass it command-line options for instance, you can run it as:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ afl-fuzz -i inputs/ -o findings/ -- /path/to/parse.exe --option=value @@</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you wish to fuzz a program that takes its input from standard input, you can also do that by removing the\n<code>@@</code> from the <code>afl-fuzz</code> invocation.</p>\n<p>Once <code>afl-fuzz</code> starts, it will draw a fancy looking table on the standard output to keep you\nupdated about its progress. From there, you'll mostly be interested in is the top right\ncorner which contains the number of crashes and hangs it has found so far:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/893fd2c3d0dfbb1c576fd016b6963e96/f2793/afl_example_output.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 63.52941176470588%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Example output from afl-fuzz\"\n        title=\"Example output from afl-fuzz\"\n        src=\"/static/893fd2c3d0dfbb1c576fd016b6963e96/c5bb3/afl_example_output.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/893fd2c3d0dfbb1c576fd016b6963e96/04472/afl_example_output.png 170w,\n/static/893fd2c3d0dfbb1c576fd016b6963e96/9f933/afl_example_output.png 340w,\n/static/893fd2c3d0dfbb1c576fd016b6963e96/c5bb3/afl_example_output.png 680w,\n/static/893fd2c3d0dfbb1c576fd016b6963e96/f2793/afl_example_output.png 743w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>You might need to change some of your CPU settings to achieve better performance while fuzzing.\n<code>afl-fuzz</code>'s output will tell you if that's the case and guide you through the steps required to\nmake that happen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-afl-to-fuzz-an-ocaml-parser\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#using-afl-to-fuzz-an-ocaml-parser\" aria-label=\"using afl to fuzz an ocaml parser permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using AFL to fuzz an OCaml parser</h2>\n<p>First of all, if you want to fuzz an OCaml program with AFL you'll need to produce an instrumented\nbinary. <code>afl-fuzz</code> has an option to work with regular binaries but you'd lose a lot of what makes it\nefficient. To instrument your binary you can simply install a <code>+afl</code> opam switch and build your\nexecutable from there. AFL compiler variants are available from OCaml <code>4.05.0</code> onwards. To install such\na switch you can run:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ opam switch create fuzzing-switch 4.07.1+afl</code></pre></div>\n<p>If your program already parses the standard input or a file given to it via the command line, you\ncan simply build the executable from your <code>+afl</code> switch and adapt the above examples. If it doesn't,\nit's still easy to fuzz any parsing function.</p>\n<p>Imagine we have a <code>simple-parser</code> library which exposes the following <code>parse_int</code> function:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> parse_int<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>int<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Msg</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> string<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> result\n<span class=\"token comment\">(** Parse the given string as an int or return [Error (`Msg _)].\n    Does not raise, usually... *)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>We want to use AFL to make sure our function is robust and won't crash when receiving unexpected\ninputs. As you can see the function returns a result and isn't supposed to raise exceptions. We want\nto make sure that's true.</p>\n<p>To find crashes, AFL traps the signals sent by your program. That means that it will consider\nuncaught OCaml exceptions as crashes. That's good because it makes it really simple to write a\n<code>fuzz_me.ml</code> executable that fits what <code>afl-fuzz</code> expects:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> file <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Sys</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>argv<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> ic <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> open_in file <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> length <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> in_channel_length ic <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> content <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> really_input_string ic length <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  close_in ic<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  ignore <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Simple_parser</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>parse_int content<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>We have to provide example inputs to AFL so we can write a <code>valid</code> file to the <code>inputs/</code> directory\ncontaining <code>123</code> and an <code>invalid</code> file containing <code>not an int</code>.

That's where <a href=\"https://github.com/stedolan/crowbar/\">Crowbar</a>\ncomes into play.</p>\n<p>Crowbar is a property-based testing framework. It's much like Haskell's <a href=\"http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck\">QuickCheck</a>.\nTo test a given function, you define how its arguments are shaped, a set of properties the result\nshould satisfy and it will make sure they hold with any combinations of randomly generated\narguments.\nLet's clarify that with an example.</p>\n<p>I wrote a library called <code>Awesome_list</code> and I want to test its <code>sort</code> function:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> sort<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int list <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> int list\n<span class=\"token comment\">(** Sorts the given list of integers. Result list is sorted in increasing\n    order, most of the time... *)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I want to make sure it really works so I'm going to use Crowbar to generate a whole lot of\nlists of integers and verify that when I sort them with <code>Awesome_list.sort</code> the result is, well...\nsorted.</p>\n<p>We'll write our tests in a <code>fuzz_me.ml</code> file.\nFirst we need to tell Crowbar how to generate arguments for our function. It exposes some\ncombinators to help you do that:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> int_list <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Crowbar</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>list <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>range <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Here we're telling Crowbar to generate lists of any size, containing integers ranging from 0\nto 10. Crowbar also exposes more complex and custom generator combinators so don't worry,\nyou can use it to build more complex arguments.</p>\n<p>Now we need to define our property. Once again it's pretty simple, we just want the output to be\nsorted:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> is_sorted l <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">rec</span> is_sorted <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span>\n    <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">_</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n    <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> hd<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>hd'<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">_</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> tl<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> hd <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;=</span> hd' <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> is_sorted tl\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token module variable\">Crowbar</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>check <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>is_sorted l<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>All that's left to do now is to register our test:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token module variable\">Crowbar</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>add_test <span class=\"token label function\">~name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Awesome_list.sort\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>int_list<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">fun</span> l <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> is_sorted <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Awesome_list</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sort l<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>and to compile that <code>fuzz_me.ml</code> file to a binary. Crowbar will take care of the magic.</p>\n<p>We can run that binary in \"Quickcheck\" mode where it will either try a certain amount of random\ninputs or keep trying until one of the properties breaks depending on the command-line options\nwe pass it.\nWhat we're interested in here is its less common \"AFL\" mode. Crowbar made it so our executable\ncan be used with <code>afl-fuzz</code> just like that:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">$ afl-fuzz -i inputs -o findings -- ./fuzz_me.exe @@</code></pre></div>\n<p>What will happen then is that our <code>fuzz_me.exe</code> binary will read the inputs provided by <code>afl-fuzz</code>\nand use it to determine which test to run and how to generate the arguments to pass to our function.\nIf the properties are satisfied, the binary will exit normally; if they aren't, it will make sure\nthat <code>afl-fuzz</code> interprets that as a crash by raising an exception.</p>\n<p>A nice side-effect of Crowbar's approach is that <code>afl-fuzz</code> will still be able to pick up\ncrashes. For instance, if we implement <code>Awesome_list.sort</code> as:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> sort <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> failwith <span class=\"token string\">\"secret crash\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">6</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> l <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token module variable\">List</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sort <span class=\"token module variable\">Pervasives</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>compare l</code></pre></div>\n<p>and use AFL and Crowbar to fuzz-test our function, it will find two crashes: one for the input\n<code>[1; 2; 3]</code> which triggers a crash and one for <code>[4; 5; 6]</code> for which the <code>is_sorted</code>\nproperty won't hold.</p>\n<p>The content of the input files found by <code>afl-fuzz</code> itself won't be of much help as it needs to be\ninterpreted by Crowbar to build the arguments that were passed to the function to trigger the bug.\nWe can invoke the <code>fuzz_me.exe</code> binary ourselves on one of the files in <code>findings/crashes</code>\nand the Crowbar binary will replay the test and give us some more helpful information about what\nexactly is going on:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">$ ./fuzz_me.exe findings/crashes/id\\:000000\\,sig\\:06\\,src\\:000011\\,op\\:flip1\\,pos\\:5 \nAwesome_list.sort: ....\nAwesome_list.sort: FAIL\n\nWhen given the input:\n\n    [1; 2; 3]\n    \nthe test threw an exception:\n\n    Failure(&quot;secret crash&quot;)\n    Raised at file &quot;stdlib.ml&quot;, line 33, characters 17-33\n    Called from file &quot;awesome-list/fuzz/fuzz_me.ml&quot;, line 11, characters 78-99\n    Called from file &quot;src/crowbar.ml&quot;, line 264, characters 16-19\n    \nFatal error: exception Crowbar.TestFailure\n$ ./fuzz_me.exe findings/crashes/id\\:000001\\,sig\\:06\\,src\\:000027\\,op\\:arith16\\,pos\\:5\\,val\\:+7 \nAwesome_list.sort: ....\nAwesome_list.sort: FAIL\n\nWhen given the input:\n\n    [4; 5; 6]\n    \nthe test failed:\n\n    check false\n    \nFatal error: exception Crowbar.TestFailure</code></pre></div>\n<p>We can see the actual inputs as well as distinguish the one that broke the invariant from the one\nthat triggered a crash.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-bun-to-run-fuzz-testing-in-ci\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#using-bun-to-run-fuzz-testing-in-ci\" aria-label=\"using bun to run fuzz testing in ci permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using <code>bun</code> to run fuzz testing in CI</h2>\n<p>While AFL and Crowbar provide no guarantees they can give you confidence that your implementation\nis not broken. Now that you know how to use them, a natural follow-up is to want to run fuzz tests\nin your CI to enforce that level of confidence.</p>\n<p>Problem is, AFL isn't very CI friendly. First it has this refreshing output that isn't going to look\ngreat on your travis builds output and it doesn't tell you much besides that it could or couldn't find\ncrashes or invariant infrigements</p>\n<p>Hopefully, like most problems, this one has a solution:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/yomimono/ocaml-bun/\"><code>bun</code></a>.\n<code>bun</code> is a CLI wrapper around <code>afl-fuzz</code>, written in OCaml, that helps you get the best out of AFL\neffortlessly. It mostly does two things:</p>\n<p>The first is that it will run several <code>afl-fuzz</code> processes in parallel\n(one per core by default). <code>afl-fuzz</code> starts with a bunch of deterministic steps. In my experience,\nusing parallel processes during this phase rarely proved very useful as they tend to find the same\nbugs or slight variations of those bugs. It only achieves its full potential in the second phase of\nfuzzing.</p>\n<p>The second thing, which is the one we're the most interested in, is that <code>bun</code> provides a useful\nand CI-friendly summary of what's going on with all the fuzzing processes so far. When one of them\nfinds a crash, it will stop all processes and pretty-print all of the bug-triggering inputs to help\nyou reproduce and debug them locally. See an example <code>bun</code> output after a crash was found:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Crashes found! Take a look; copy/paste to save for reproduction:\n1432\techo JXJpaWl0IA== | base64 -d &gt; crash_0.$(date -u +%s)\n1433\techo NXJhkV8QAA== | base64 -d &gt; crash_1.$(date -u +%s)\n1434\techo J3Jh//9qdGFiYmkg | base64 -d &gt; crash_2.$(date -u +%s)\n1435\t09:35.32:[ERROR]All fuzzers finished, but some crashes were found!</code></pre></div>\n<p>Using <code>bun</code> is very similar to using <code>afl-fuzz</code>. Going back to our first parser example, we can\nfuzz it with <code>bun</code> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ bun --input inputs/ --output findings/ /path/to/parse.exe</code></pre></div>\n<p>You'll note that you don't need to provide the <code>@@</code> anymore. <code>bun</code> assumes that it should pass the\ninput as the first argument of your to-be-fuzzed binary.</p>\n<p><code>bun</code> also comes with an alternative <code>no-kill</code> mode which lets all the fuzzers run indefinitely\ninstead of terminating them whenever a crash is discovered. It will regularly keep you updated on\nthe number of crashes discovered so far and when terminated will pretty-print each of them just like\nit does in regular mode.</p>\n<p>This mode can be convenient if you suspect your implementation may contain a lot of bugs and\nyou don't want to go through the whole process of fuzz testing it to only find a single bug.</p>\n<p>You can use it in CI by running <code>bun --no-kill</code> via <code>timeout</code>. For instance:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">timeout --preserve-status 60m bun --no-kill --input inputs --output findings ./fuzz_me.exe</code></pre></div>\n<p>will fuzz <code>fuzz_me.exe</code> for an hour no matter what happens. When <code>timeout</code> terminates <code>bun</code>, it will\nprovide you with a handful of bugs to fix!</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-words\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#final-words\" aria-label=\"final words permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Final words</h2>\n<p>I really want to encourage you to use those tools and fuzzing in general.\nCrowbar and <code>bun</code> are fairly new so you will probably encounter bugs or find that it lacks a feature\nyou want but combined with AFL they make for very nice tools to effectively test\ncritical components of your OCaml code base or infrastructure and detect newly-introduced bugs.\nThey are already used accross the MirageOS ecosystem where it has been used to fuzz the TCP/IP stack\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip\">mirage-tcpip</a> and the DHCP implementation <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/charrua\">charrua</a> thanks to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/yomimono/somerandompacket\">somerandompacket</a>.\nYou can consult Crowbar's <a href=\"https://github.com/stedolan/crowbar/issues/2\">hall of fame</a> to find out about bugs uncovered by this\napproach.</p>\n<p>I also encourage anyone interested to join us in using this promising toolchain, report those bugs,\ncontribute those extra features and help the community build more robust software.</p>\n<p>Finally if you wish to learn more about how to efficienly use fuzzing for testing I recommend the\nexcellent <a href=\"https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1687\">Write Fuzzable Code</a> article by John Regehr.</p>"

They don't operate on your code directly but on the Abstract Syntax Tree or AST resulting\nfrom its parsing. That means that they can only be applied to syntactically correct OCaml code. You\ncan think of them as functions that take an AST and return a new AST.</p>\n<p>That means that in theory you can do a lot of things with a PPX, including pretty bad and cryptic\nthings. You could for example replace every instance of <code>true</code> by <code>false</code>, swap the branches of any\n<code>if-then-else</code> or randomize the order of every pattern-matching case.\nObviously that's not the kind of behaviour that we want as it would make it impossible to\nunderstand the code since it would be so far from the actual AST the compiler would get.\nIn practice PPX-es have a well defined scope and only transform parts you explicitly annotated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-the-ocaml-ast\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#understanding-the-ocaml-ast\" aria-label=\"understanding the ocaml ast permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Understanding the OCaml AST</h3>\n<p>First things first, what is an AST. An AST is an abstract representation of your code. As the name\nsuggests it has a tree-like structure where the root describes your entire file. It has children for\neach bits such as a function declaration or a type definition, each of them having their own\nchildren, for example for the function name, its argument and its body and that goes on until you\nreach a leaf such as a literal <code>1</code>, <code>\"abc\"</code> or a variable for instance.\nIn the case of OCaml it's a set of recursive types allowing us to represent OCaml code as an OCaml\nvalue. This value is what the parser passes to the compiler so it can type check and compile it to\nnative or byte code.\nThose types are defined in OCaml's <code>Parsetree</code> module. The entry points there are the <code>structure</code>\ntype which describes the content of an <code>.ml</code> file and the <code>signature</code> type which describes the\ncontent of an <code>.mli</code> file.</p>\n<p>As mentionned above, a PPX can be seen as a function that transforms an AST. Writing a PPX thus\nrequires you to understand the AST, both to interpret the one you'll get as input and\nto produce the right one as output. This is probably the trickiest part as unless you've already\nworked on the OCaml compiler or written a PPX rewriter, that will probably be the first time you two\nmeet. Chances are also high that'll be a pretty bad first date and you will need some to time\nto get to know each other.</p>\n<p>The <code>Parsetree</code> module <a href=\"https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/compilerlibref/Parsetree.html\">documentation</a>,\nis a good place to start. The above mentioned <code>structure</code> and <code>signature</code> types are at the root of\nthe AST but some other useful types to look at at first are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>expression</code> which describes anything in OCaml that evaluates to a value, the right hand side of a\n<code>let</code> binding for instance.</li>\n<li><code>pattern</code> which is what you use to deconstruct an OCaml value, the left hand side of a <code>let</code>\nbinding or a pattern-matching case for example.</li>\n<li><code>core_type</code> which describes type expressions ie what you would find on the right hand side of a\nvalue description in a <code>.mli</code>, ie <code>val f : &#x3C;what_goes_there></code>.</li>\n<li><code>structure_item</code> and <code>signature_item</code> which describe the top level AST nodes you can find in a\n<code>structure</code> or <code>signature</code> such as type definitions, value or module declarations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thing is, it's a bit a rough and there's no detailed explanation about how a specific bit of code is\nrepresented, just type definitions. Most of the time, the type, field, and variant names are\nself-explanatory but it can get harder with some of the more advanced language features.\nIt turns out there are plenty of comments that are really helpful in the actual <code>parsetree.mli</code> file\nand that aren't part of the generated documentation. You can find them on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/parsing/parsetree.mli\">github</a> but I personally prefer to\nhave it opened in a VIM tab when I work on a PPX so I usually open\n<code>~/.opam/&#x3C;current_working_switch>/lib/ocaml/compiler-libs/parsetree.mli</code>.</p>\n<p>This works well while exploring but you might also want a more straightforward approach to\ndiscovering what the AST representation is for some specific OCaml code. The\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_tools\"><code>ppx_tools</code></a> opam package comes with a <code>dumpast</code> binary\nthat pretty prints the AST for any given piece of valid OCaml code. You can install it using opam:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$opam install ppx_tools</code></pre></div>\n<p>and then run it using <code>ocamlfind</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ocamlfind ppx_tools/dumpast some_file.ml</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can use it on <code>.ml</code> and <code>.mli</code> files or to quickly get the AST for an expression with the <code>-e</code>\noption:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ocamlfind ppx_tools/dumpast -e &quot;1 + 1&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>Similarly, you can use the <code>-t</code> or <code>-p</code> options to respectively pretty print ASTs from type\nexpressions or patterns.</p>\n<p>Using <code>dumpast</code> to get both the ASTs of a piece of code using your future PPX and the resulting\npreprocessed code is a good way to start and will help you figure out what are the steps required to\nget there.</p>\n<p>Note that you can use the compiler or <code>utop</code> have a similar feature with the <code>-dparsetree</code> flag.\nRunning <code>ocamlc/ocamlopt -dparsetree file.ml</code> will pretty print the AST of the given file while\nrunning <code>utop -dparsetree</code> will pretty print the AST of the evaluated code alongside it's\nevaluation.\nI tend to prefer the pretty printed AST from <code>dumpast</code> but any of these tools will prove helpful\nin understanding the AST representation of a given piece of OCaml code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"language-extensions-interpreted-by-ppx-es\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#language-extensions-interpreted-by-ppx-es\" aria-label=\"language extensions interpreted by ppx es permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Language extensions interpreted by PPX-es</h3>\n<p>OCaml 4.02 introduced syntax extensions meant to be used by external tools such as PPX-es. Knowing\ntheir syntax and meaning is important to understand how most of the existing rewriters\nwork because they usually look for those language extensions in the AST to know which part of it\nthey need to modify.</p>\n<p>The two language extensions we're interested in here are extension nodes and attributes. They are\ndefined in detail in the OCaml manual (see the\n<a href=\"https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/attributes.html\">attributes</a> and\n<a href=\"https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/extensionnodes.html\">extension nodes</a> sections) but I'll\ntry to give a good summary here.</p>\n<p>Extension nodes are used in place of expressions, module expressions, patterns, type expressions or\nmodule type expressions. Their syntax is <code>[%extension_name payload]</code>. We'll come back to the payload\npart a little later.\nYou can also find extension nodes at the top level of modules or module signatures with the syntax\n<code>[%%extension_name payload]</code>.\nHopefully the following cheatsheet can help you remember the basics of how and where you can use\nthem:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> t <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> a <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> b <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext pl<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">match</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext pl<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext pl<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%%</span>ext pl<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Because extension nodes stand where regular AST nodes should, the compiler won't accept them and\nwill give you an <code>Uninterpreted extension</code> error. Extension nodes have to be expanded by a PPX for\nyour code to compile.</p>\n<p>Attributes are slightly different although their syntax is very close to extensions. Attributes\nare attached to existing AST nodes instead of replacing them. That means that they don't necessarily\nneed to be transformed and the compiler will ignore unknown attributes by default.\nThey can come with a payload just like extensions and use <code>@</code> instead of <code>%</code>. The number of <code>@</code>\npreceding the attribute name specifies which kind of node they are attached to:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@</span>attr pl<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"some string\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@@</span>attr pl<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@@@</span>attr pl<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In the first example, the attribute is attached to the expression <code>12</code> while in the second example\nit is attached to the whole <code>let b = \"some string\"</code> value binding. The third one is of a slightly\ndifferent nature as it is a floating attribute. It's not attached to anything per-se and just ends\nup in the AST as a structure item.\nBecause there is a wide variety of nodes to which you can attach attributes, I won't go too far into\ndetails here but a good rule of thumb is that you use <code>@@</code> attributes when you want them attached to\nstructure or signature items, for anything deeper within the AST structure such as patterns,\nexpressions or core types, use the single <code>@</code> syntax. Looking at the <code>Parsetree</code> documentation can\nhelp you figure out where you can find attributes.</p>\n<p>Now let's talk about those payloads I mentioned earlier. You can think of them as \"arguments\" to\nthe extension points and attributes. You can pass different kinds of arguments and the syntax varies\nfor each of them:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext expr_or_str_item<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> \n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> type_expr_or_sig_item<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> c <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext<span class=\"token operator\">?</span> pattern<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>As suggested in the examples, you can pass expressions or structure items using a space character,\ntype expressions or signature items (anything you'd find at the top level of a module signature)\nusing a <code>:</code> or a pattern using a <code>?</code>.</p>\n<p>Attributes' payload use the same syntax:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'a'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@</span>attr expr_or_str_item<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'b'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@</span>attr<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> type_expr_or_sig_item<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'a'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@</span>attr<span class=\"token operator\">?</span> pattern<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Some PPX-es rely on other language extensions such as the suffix character you can attach to <code>int</code>\nand <code>float</code> literals (<code>10z</code> could be used by a PPX to turn it into <code>Z.of_string \"10\"</code> for instance)\nor quoted strings with a specific identifier (<code>{ppx_name|some quoted string|ppx_name}</code> can be used\nif you want your PPX to operate on arbitrary strings and not only syntactically correct OCaml) but\nattributes and extensions are the most commonly used ones.</p>\n<p>Attributes and extension points can be expressed using an infix syntax. The attribute version is\nbarely used but some forms of the infix syntax for extension points are used by popular PPX-es and\nit is likely you will encounter some of the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> infix_let_extension <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> infix_match_extension <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">match</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext y <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> infix_try_extension <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">try</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext f z <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">_</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>which are syntactic sugar for:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> infix_let_extension <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> infix_match_extension <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext <span class=\"token keyword\">match</span> y <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> infix_try_extension <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>ext <span class=\"token keyword\">try</span> f z <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">_</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A good example of a PPX making heavy use of these if\n<a href=\"http://ocsigen.org/lwt/4.1.0/api/Ppx_lwt\"><code>lwt_ppx</code></a>.

Good\nexamples of derivers are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving\"><code>ppx_deriving</code></a> itself comes with a bunch of deriving\nplugins such as <code>eq</code>, <code>ord</code> or <code>show</code> which respectively derives, as you might have guessed,\nequality, comparison and pretty-printing functions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving_yojson\"><code>ppx_deriving_yojson</code></a> which derives JSON\nserializers and deserializers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_sexp_conv\"><code>ppx_sexp_conv</code></a> which derives s-expressions\nconverters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Derivers often let you attach attributes to specify how some parts of the AST should be handled.

The type for <code>Ast_pattern</code> is defined as <code>('a, 'b, 'c) t</code> where <code>'a</code> is\nthe type of AST nodes that are matched, <code>'b</code> is the type of the values you're extracting from the\nnode as a function type and <code>'c</code> is the return type of that last function. This sounded really\nconfusing to me at first and I'm guessing it might do to some of you too so let's give it a bit of\ncontext.</p>\n<p>Let's look at the type of <code>Extension.declare</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> declare <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  string <span class=\"token operator\">-></span>\n  <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'context</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Context</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t <span class=\"token operator\">-></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>payload<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'context</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Ast_pattern</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t <span class=\"token operator\">-></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>loc<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Location</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> path<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>string <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span>\n  t</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, the expected pattern first type parameter is <code>payload</code> which means we want a pattern that\nmatches <code>payload</code> AST nodes. That makes perfect sense since it is used to describe what your\nextension's payload should look like and what to do with it.\nThe last type parameter is <code>'context</code> which again seems logical. As I mentioned earlier our\n<code>expand_function</code> should return the same kind of node as the one where the extension was found.\nNow what about <code>'a</code>. As you can see, it describes what comes after the base <code>loc</code> and <code>path</code>\nparameters of our <code>expand_function</code>. From the pattern point of view, <code>'a</code> describes the parts of the\nmatched AST node we wish to extract for later consumption, here by our expander.</p>\n<p><code>Ast_pattern</code> contains a whole bunch of combinators to let you describe what your pattern should match\nand a specific <code>__</code> pattern that you must use to capture the various parts of the matched nodes.\n<code>__</code> has type <code>('a, 'a -> 'b, 'b) Ast_pattern.t</code> which means that whenever it's used it changes the\ntype of consumer function in the returned pattern.</p>\n<p>Let's consider a few examples to try wrapping our heads around this. Say I want to write an\nextension that takes an expression as a payload and I want to pass this expression to my expander so\nI can generate code based on its value. I can declare the extension like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> extension <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token module variable\">Extension</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>declare\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"my_extension\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token module variable\">Extension</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Context</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>expression\n    <span class=\"token module variable\">Ast_pattern</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>single_expr_payload __<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    expand_function</code></pre></div>\n<p>In this example, <code>Extension.Context.expression</code> has type <code>expression Extension.Context.t</code>, the\npattern has type <code>(payload, expression -> expression, expression) Ast_pattern.t</code>. The pattern says we\nwant to allow a single expression in the payload and capture it. If we decompose it a bit, we can\nsee that <code>single_expr_payload</code> has type\n<code>(expression, 'a, 'b) Ast_pattern.t -> (payload, 'a, 'b) Ast_pattern.t</code> and is passed <code>__</code> which\nmakes it a <code>(expression, expression -> 'b, 'b) Ast_pattern.t</code> and that's exactly what we want here\nas our expander will have type <code>loc: Location.t -> path: string -> expression -> expression</code>!</p>\n<p>It works similarly to <code>Scanf.scanf</code> when you think about it. Changing the pattern changes the type of the\nconsumer function the same way changing the format string does for <code>Scanf</code> functions.</p>\n<p>This was a bit easy since we had a custom combinator just for that purpose so let's take a few more\ncomplex examples. Now say we want to only allow pairs of integer and string constants expressions in\nour payload. Instead of just capturing any expression and dealing with the error cases in the\n<code>expand_function</code> we can let <code>Ast_pattern</code> deal with that and pass an <code>int</code> and <code>string</code> along to\nour expander:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token module variable\">Ast_pattern</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>single_expr_payload <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>pexp_tuple <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>eint __<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token operator\">^::</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>estring __<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token operator\">^::</span>nil<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This one's a bit more elaborate but the idea is the same, we use <code>__</code> to capture the int and string\nfrom the expression and use combinators to specify that the payload should be made of a pair and\nthat gives us a: <code>(payload, int -> string -> 'a, 'a) Ast_pattern.t</code> which should be used with a\n<code>loc: Location.t -> path: string -> int -> string -> expression</code> expander.</p>\n<p>We can also specify that our extension should take something else than an expression as a payload,\nsay a pattern with no <code>when</code> clause so that it's applied as <code>[%my_ext? some_pattern_payload]</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token module variable\">Ast_pattern</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ppat __ none<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>or no payload at all and it should just be invoked as <code>[%my_ext]</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token module variable\">Ast_pattern</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>pstr nil<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>You should play with <code>Ast_pattern</code> a bit if you need to express complex patterns as I think it's\nthe only way to get the hang of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-a-deriver\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#writing-a-deriver\" aria-label=\"writing a deriver permalink\"

In this case we'd need to add a <code>[@@deriving my_deriver]</code> to\na type declaration in a structure or a signature to use it.\nThen there's just one optional argument per kind of node to which you can attach a <code>[@@deriving ...]</code>\nattribute. <code>type_decl</code> correspond to <code>type = ...</code>, <code>type_ext</code> to <code>type += ...</code> and <code>exception</code> to\n<code>exception My_exc of ...</code>.\nYou need to provide generators for the ones you wish your deriver to handle, <code>ppxlib</code>\nwill make sure users get a compile error if they try to use it elsewhere.\nWe can ignore the <code>extension</code> as it's just here for compatibility with <code>ppx_deriving</code>.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at <code>Generator</code>. Its type is defined as <code>('output_ast, 'input_ast) t</code> where\n<code>'input_ast</code> is the type of the node to which the <code>[@@deriving ...]</code> is attached and <code>'output_ast</code>\nthe type of the nodes it should produce, ie either a <code>structure</code> or a <code>signature</code>. The type of a\ngenerator depends on the expand function it's built from when you use the smart constructor\n<code>make_no_arg</code> meaning the expand function should have type\n<code>loc: Location.t -> path: string -> 'input_ast -> 'output_ast</code>. This function is the actual\nimplementation of your deriver and will generate the list of <code>structure_item</code> or <code>signature_item</code>\nfrom the type declaration.</p>\n<h4 id=\"compatibility-with-ppx_import\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#compatibility-with-ppx_import\" aria-label=\"compatibility with ppx_import permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Compatibility with <code>ppx_import</code></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_import\"><code>ppx_import</code></a> is a PPX rewriter that lets you import type\ndefinitions and spares you the need to copy and update them every time they change upstream. The\nmain reason why you would want to do that is because you need to derive values from those types\nusing a deriver thus the importance of ensuring your deriving plugin is compatible.</p>\n<p>Let's take an example to illustrate how <code>ppx_import</code> is used. I'm using a library called <code>blob</code>\nwhich exposes a type <code>Blob.t</code>. For some reason I need to be able to serialize and deserialize\n<code>Blob.t</code> values to JSON. I'd like to use a deriver to do that as I don't want to maintain that code\nmyself. Imagine <code>Blob.t</code> is defined as:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> t <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">value</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> length <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> id <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Without <code>ppx_import</code> I would define somewhere a <code>serializable_blob</code> type as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> serializable_blob <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Blob</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">value</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> length <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> id <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@@</span>deriving yojson<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>That works well especially because the type definition is simple but I don't really care about\nhaving it here, what I really want is just the <code>to_yojson</code> and <code>of_yojson</code> functions. Also now, if\nthe type definition changes, I have to update it here manually. Maintaining many such imports can be\ntedious and duplicates a lot of code unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>What I can do instead, thanks to <code>ppx_import</code> is to write it like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> serializable_blob <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>import<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Blob</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@@</span>deriving yojson<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>which will ultimately be expanded into the above using <code>Blob</code>'s definition of the type <code>t</code>.</p>\n<p>Now <code>ppx_import</code> works a bit differently from regular PPX rewriters as it needs a bit more information\nthan just the AST. We don't need to understand how it works but what it means is that if your\nderiving plugin is used with <code>ppx_import</code>, it will be called twice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A first time with <code>ocamldep</code>. This is required to determine the dependencies of a module in terms\nof other OCaml modules. PPX-es need to be applied here to find out about dependencies they may\nintroduce.</li>\n<li>A second time before actually compiling the code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue here is that during the <code>ocamldep</code> pass, <code>ppx_import</code> doesn't have the information it\nneeds to import the type definition yet so it can't copy it and it expands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> u <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span>import A<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>into:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> u <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> A<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t</code></pre></div>\n<p>Only during the second pass will it actually expand it to the copied type definition.</p>\n<p>This may be a concern if your deriving plugin can't apply to abstract types because you will\nprobably raise an error when encountering one, meaning the first phase will fail and the whole\ncompilation will fail without giving your rewriter a chance to derive anything from the copied\ntype definition.</p>\n<p>The right way to deal with this is to have different a behaviour in the context of <code>ocamldep</code>.\nIn this case you can ignore such type declaration or eventually, if you know you are going to\ninject new dependencies in your generated code, to create dummy values referencing them and just\nbehave normally in any other context.</p>\n<p><code>ppxlib</code> versions <code>0.6.0</code> and higher allow you to do so through the <code>Deriving.Generator.V2</code> API\nwhich passes an abstract <code>ctxt</code> value to your <code>expand</code> function instead of a <code>loc</code> and a <code>path</code>.\nYou can tell whether it is the <code>ocamldep</code> pass from within the <code>expand</code> function like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">open</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Ppxlib</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> expand <span class=\"token label function\">~ctxt</span> input_ast <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> omp_config <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Expansion_context</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Deriver</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>omp_config ctxt <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> is_ocamldep_pass <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">String</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>equal <span class=\"token string\">\"ocamldep\"</span> omp_config<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Migrate_parsetree</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Driver</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>tool_name <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4 id=\"deriver-attributes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#deriver-attributes\" aria-label=\"deriver attributes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Deriver attributes</h4>\n<p>You'll have noted the <code>attributes</code> parameter in the examples. It's an optional parameter that lets\nyou define which attributes your deriver allows the user to attach to various bits of the type,\ntype extension or exception declaration it is applied to.</p>\n<p><code>ppxlib</code> comes with a <code>Attribute</code> module that lets you to properly declare the attributes you want\nto allow and make sure they are properly used: correctly spelled, placed and with the right\npayload attached. This is especially useful since attributes are by default ignored by the compiler\nmeaning without <code>ppxlib</code>'s care, plugin users wouldn't get any errors if they misused an attribute\nand it might take them a while to figure out they got it wrong and the generated code wasn't\nimpacted as they hoped.\nThe <code>Attribute</code> module offers another great feature: <code>Attribute.t</code> values can be used to extract the\nattribute payload from an AST node if it is present. That will spare you the need for\ninspecting attributes yourself which can prove quite tedious.</p>\n<p><code>Ppxlib.Attribute.t</code> is defined as <code>('context, 'payload) t</code> where <code>'context</code> describes to which node\nthe attribute can be attached and <code>'payload</code>, the type of its payload.\nTo build such an attribute you must use <code>Ppxlib.Attribute.declare</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> declare\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>  string\n  <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'a</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Context</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t\n  <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>payload<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'b</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'c</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Ast_pattern</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t\n  <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'b</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token type-variable function\">'a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'c</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> t</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let's try to declare the <code>default</code> argument from <code>ppx_deriving_yojson</code> I mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>The first <code>string</code> argument is the attribute name. <code>ppxlib</code> support namespaces for the attributes so\nthat users can avoid conflicting attributes between various derivers applied to the same type\ndefinitions. For instance here we could use <code>\"default\"</code>. It can prove helpful to use more qualified\nname such as <code>\"ppx_deriving_yojson.of_yojson.default\"</code>. That means that our attribute can be used as\n<code>[@@default ...]</code>, <code>[@@of_yojson.default ...]</code> or <code>[@@ppx_deriving.of_yojson.default ...]</code>.\nNow if another deriver uses a <code>[@@default ...]</code>, users can apply both derivers and provide different\n<code>default</code> values to the different derivers by writing:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> t <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> a <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> b <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@</span>make<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>default <span class=\"token string\">\"abc\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@</span>of_yojson<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>default <span class=\"token string\">\"\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">@@</span>deriving make<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>of_yojson<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The context argument works very similarly to the one in <code>Extension.declare</code>. Here we want the\nattribute to be attached to record field declarations so we'll use\n<code>Attribute.Context.label_declaration</code> which has type <code>label_declaration Attribute.Context.t</code>.</p>\n<p>The pattern argument is an <code>Ast_pattern.t</code>. Now that we know how to work with those this is pretty\neasy. Here we need to accept any expression as a payload since we should be able to apply the\n<code>default</code> attribute to any field, regardless of its type and we want to extract that expression from\nthe payload so we can use it in our deserializer so let's use\n<code>Ast_pattern.(single_expr_payload __)</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally the last <code>'b</code> argument has the same type as the pattern consumer function. We can use it to\ntransform what we extracted using the previous <code>Ast_pattern</code> but in this case we just want to\nkeep the expression as we got it so we'll just use the identity function here.</p>\n<p>We end up with the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> default_attribute <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token module variable\">Attribute</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>declare\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"ppx_deriving_yojson.of_yojson.default\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token module variable\">Attribute</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Context</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>label_declaration\n    <span class=\"token module variable\">Ast_pattern</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>single_expr_payload __<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">fun</span> expr <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> expr<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>and that gives us a <code>(label_declaration, expression) Attribute.t</code>.</p>\n<p>You can then use it to collect the attribute payload from a label_declaration:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token module variable\">Attribute</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>get default_attribute label_decl</code></pre></div>\n<p>which will return <code>Some expr</code> if the attribute was attached to <code>label_decl</code> or <code>None</code> otherwise.</p>\n<p>Because of their polymorphic nature, attributes need to be packed, ie to be wrapped with a variant\nto hide the type parameter, so if you want to pass it to <code>Generator.make_no_arg</code> you'll have to do\nit like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> attributes <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Attribute</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>T default_attribute<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3 id=\"writing-your-expand-functions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#writing-your-expand-functions\" aria-label=\"writing your expand functions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Writing your expand functions</h3>\n<p>In the two last sections I mentioned <code>expand</code> functions that would contain the actual <code>deriver</code> or\n<code>extension</code> implementation but didn't actually said anything about how to write those. It will\ndepend a lot on the purpose of your PPX rewriter and what you're trying to achieve.</p>\n<p>Before writing your PPX you should clearly specify what it should be applied to and what code it\nshould produce. That will help you declaring the right deriving or extension rewriter and from there\nyou'll know the type of the <code>expand</code> functions you have to write which should help.</p>\n<p>A good way to proceed is to use the <code>dumpast</code> tool to pretty print the AST fragments of both the\ninput of your expander and the output, ie the code it should generate. To take a concrete example,\nsay you want to write a deriving plugin that generates an <code>equal</code> function from a type definition.\nYou can start by running <code>dumpast</code> on the following file:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> some_record <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> a <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int64\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> b <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> equal_some_record r r' <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Int64</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>equal r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>a r'<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>a <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">String</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>equal r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>b r'<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>b</code></pre></div>\n<p>That will give you the AST representation of a record type definition and the equal function you\nwant to write so you can figure out how to deconstruct your expander's input to be able to generate\nthe right output.</p>\n<p><code>ppxlib</code> exposes smart constructors in <code>Ppxlib.Ast_builder.Default</code> to help you build AST fragments\nwithout having to care too much attributes and such fields as well as some convenience constructors\nto keep your code concise and readable.</p>\n<p>Another convenience tool <code>ppxlib</code> exposes to help you build AST fragments is <code>metaquot</code>. I recently\nwrote a bit of documentation about it\n<a href=\"https://ppxlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ppx-for-plugin-authors.html#metaquot\">here</a> which you\nshould take a look at but to sum it up <code>metaquot</code> is a PPX extension allowing you to write AST nodes\nusing the OCaml syntax they describe instead of the AST types.</p>\n<h4 id=\"handling-code-locations-in-a-ppx-rewriter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#handling-code-locations-in-a-ppx-rewriter\" aria-label=\"handling code locations in a ppx rewriter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Handling code locations in a PPX rewriter</h4>\n<p>When building AST fragments you should keep in mind that you have to set their <code>location</code>. Locations\nare part of the AST values that describes the position of the corresponding node in your source\nfile, including the file name and the line number and offset of both the beginning and the end the\ncode bit they represent.</p>\n<p>Because your code was generated after the file was parsed, it doesn't have a location so you need to\nset it yourself. One could think that it doesn't matter and we could use a dummy location but\nlocations are used by the compiler to properly report errors and that's why a PPX rewriter should care\nabout how it locates the generated code as it will help the end user to understand whether the error\ncomes from their code or generated code and how to eventually fix it.</p>\n<p>Both <code>Ast_builder</code> and <code>metaquot</code> expect a location. The first explicitly takes it as a labelled\n<code>loc</code> argument while the second relies on a <code>loc</code> value being available in the scope. It is\nimportant to set those with care as errors in the generated code doesn't necessarily mean that your\nrewriter is bugged. There are valid cases where your rewriter functioned as intended but the generated\ncode triggers an error. PPX-es often work on the assumption that some values are available in the\nscope, if the user doesn't properly provide those it's their responsibility to fix the error. To\nhelp them do so, it is important to properly locate the generated code to guide them as much as\npossible.</p>\n<p>When writing extensions, using the whole extension point location for the generated code makes\nperfect sense as that's where the code will sit. That's fairly easy as this what <code>ppxlib</code> passes\nto the expand function through the <code>loc</code> labelled argument. For deriving plugins it's a bit different\nas the generated code doesn't replace an existing part of the parsed AST but generate a new one to insert.\nCurrently <code>ppxlib</code> gives you the <code>loc</code> of the whole type declaration, extension or exception\ndeclaration your deriving plugin is applied to. Ideally it would be nice to be able to locate the\ngenerated code on the plugin name in the <code>deriving</code> attribute payload, ie here:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[@@deriving my_plugin,another_plugin]\n            ^^^^^^^^^</code></pre></div>\n<p>I'm currently working on making that location available to the <code>expand</code> function. In the meantime,\nyou should choose a convention. I personally locate all the generated code on the\ntype declaration. Some choose to locate the generated code on the part of the input AST they're\nhandling when generating it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reporting-errors-to-your-rewriter-users\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reporting-errors-to-your-rewriter-users\" aria-label=\"reporting errors to your rewriter users permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reporting errors to your rewriter users</h4>\n<p>You won't always be able to handle all the AST nodes passed to your expand functions, either because the\nend user misused your rewriter or because there are some cases you simply can't deal with.</p>\n<p>In those cases you can report the error to the user with <code>Ppxlib.Location.raise_errorf</code>. It works\nsimilarly to <code>printf</code> and you can build your error message from a format string and extra\narguments. It will then raise an exception which will be caught and reported by the compiler.\nA good practice is to prefix the error message with the name of your rewriter to help users understand\nwhat's going on, especially with deriving plugin as they might use several of them on the same type\ndeclaration.</p>\n<p>Another point to take care of here is, again, locations. <code>raise_errorf</code> takes a labelled <code>loc</code>\narguments. It is used so that your error is reported as any compiler error. Having good locations in\nthose error messages is just as important as sending clear error messages. Keep in mind that both\nthe errors you report yourself or errors coming from your generated code will be highlighted by\nmerlin so when properly set they make it much easier to work with your PPX rewriter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testing-your-ppx\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#testing-your-ppx\" aria-label=\"testing your ppx permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Testing your PPX</h3>\n<p>Just as most pieces of code do, a PPX deserves to be tested and it has become easier over the years to\ntest rewriters.</p>\n<p>I personally tend to write as many unit test as possible for my PPX-es internal libraries. I try to\nextract helper functions that can easily be unit-tested but I can't test it all that way.\nTesting the <code>ast -> ast</code> functions would be tedious as <code>ppxlib</code> and <code>ocaml-migrate-parsetree</code>\ndon't provide comparison and pretty printing functions that you can use with <code>alcotest</code> or <code>oUnit</code>.\nThat means you'd have to import the AST types and derive them on your own. That would make a lot\nof boiler plate and even if those functions were exposed, writing such tests would be really\ntedious. There's a lot of things to take into account. How are you going to build the input AST values\nfor instance?  If you use <code>metaquot</code>, every node will share the same loc, making it hard to test\nthat your errors are properly located. If you don't, you will end up with insanely long and\nunreadable test code or fixtures.\nWhile that would allow extremely accurate testing for the generated code and errors, it will almost\ncertainly make your test code unmaintainable, at least given the current tooling.</p>\n<p>Don't panic, there is a very good and simple alternative. <code>ppxlib</code> makes it very easy to build a\nbinary that will parse OCaml code, preprocess the AST with your rewriter and spit it out, formatted as\ncode again.</p>\n<p>You just have to write the following <code>pp.ml</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Ppxlib</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Driver</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>standalone <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>and build the binary with the following <code>dune</code> stanza, assuming your rewriter is called\n<code>my_ppx_rewriter</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(executable\n (name pp)\n (modules pp)\n (libraries my_ppx_rewriter ppxlib))</code></pre></div>\n<p>Because we're humans and the OCaml syntax is meant for us to write and read, it makes for much better\ntest input/output. You can now write your test input in a regular <code>.ml</code> file, use the <code>pp.exe</code>\nbinary to \"apply\" your preprocessor to it and compare the output with another <code>.ml</code> file containing\nthe code you expect it to generate. This kind of test pattern is really well supported by <code>dune</code>\nthanks to the <code>diff</code> user action.</p>\n<p>I usually have the following files in a <code>rewriter</code>/<code>deriver</code> folder within my test directory:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">test/rewriter/\n\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 dune\n\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 test.expected.ml\n\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 pp.ml\n\226\148\148\226\148\128\226\148\128 test.ml</code></pre></div>\n<p>Where <code>pp.ml</code> is used to produce the rewriter binary, <code>test.ml</code> contains the input OCaml code and\n<code>test.expected.ml</code> the result of preprocessing <code>test.ml</code>. The dune file content is generally similar\nto this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(executable\n (name pp)\n (modules pp)\n (libraries my_ppx_rewriter ppxlib))\n\n(rule\n (targets test.actual.ml)\n (deps (:pp pp.exe) (:input test.ml))\n (action (run ./%{pp} -deriving-keep-w32 both --impl %{input} -o %{targets})))\n\n(alias\n (name runtest)\n (action (diff test.expected.ml test.actual.ml)))\n\n(test\n  (name test)\n  (modules test)\n  (preprocess (pps my_ppx_rewriter)))</code></pre></div>\n<p>The first stanza is the one I already introduced above and specifies how to build the rewriter binary.</p>\n<p>The <code>rule</code> stanza that comes after that indicates to <code>dune</code> how to produce the actual test output by\napplying the rewriter binary to <code>test.ml</code>. You probably noticed the <code>-deriving-keep-w32 both</code> CLI\noption passed to <code>pp.exe</code>. By default, <code>ppxlib</code> will generate values or add attributes so that your\ngenerated code doesn't trigger a \"Unused value\" warning. This is useful in real life situation but\nhere it will just pollute the test output and make it harder to read so we disable that feature.</p>\n<p>The following <code>alias</code> stanza is where all the magic happens. Running <code>dune runtest</code> will now\ngenerate <code>test.actual.ml</code> and compare it to <code>test.expected.ml</code>. It will not only do that but show\nyou how they differ from each other in a diff format. You can then automatically update\n<code>test.expected.ml</code> if you're happy with the results by running <code>dune promote</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally the last <code>test</code> stanza is there to ensure that the generated code compiles without type\nerrors.</p>\n<p>This makes a very convenient test setup to write your PPX-es TDD style. You can start by writing an\nidentity PPX, that will just return its input AST as it is. Then you add some OCaml code using your\nsoon to be PPX in <code>test.ml</code> and run <code>dune runtest --auto-promote</code> to prefill <code>test.expected.ml</code>.\nFrom there you can start implementing your rewriter and run <code>dune runtest</code> to check on your progress\nand update the expected result with <code>dune promote</code>.\nGoing pure TDD by writing the test works but it's tricky cause you'd have to format your code the\nsame way <code>pp.exe</code> will format the AST. It would be great to be able to specify how to format\nthe generated <code>test.actual.ml</code> so that this approach would be more viable and the diff more\nreadable. Being able to use ocamlformat with a very diff friendly configuration would be great\nthere. <code>pp.exe</code> seems to offer CLI options to change the code style such as <code>-styler</code> but I haven't\nhad the chance to experiment with those yet.</p>\n<p>Now you can test successful rewriting this way but what about errors? There's a lot of value\nensuring you produce the right errors and on the right code location because that's the kind of\nthings you can get wrong when refactoring your rewriter code or when people try to contribute.\nThat isn't as likely to happen if your CI yells when you break the error reporting. So how do we do\nthat?</p>\n<p>Well pretty much the exact same way! We write a file with an erroneous invocation of our rewriter,\nrun <code>pp.exe</code> on it and compare stderr with what we expect it to be.\nThere are two major differences here. First we want to collect the stderr output of the rewriter\nbinary instead of using it to generate a file. The second is that we cant write all of our test\ncases in a single file since <code>pp.exe</code> will stop at the first error. That means we need one <code>.ml</code>\nfile per error test case.\nLuckily for us, dune offers ways to do both.</p>\n<p>For every error test file we will want to add the following stanzas:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(rule\n  (targets test_error.actual)\n  (deps (:pp pp.exe) (:input test_error.ml)) \n  (action\n    (with-stderr-to\n      %{targets}\n      (bash &quot;./%{pp} -no-color --impl %{input} || true&quot;)\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n(alias\n  (name runtest)\n  (action (diff test_error.expected test_error.actual))\n)</code></pre></div>\n<p>but obviously we don't want to do that by hand every time we add a new test case so we're gonna need\na script to generate those stanzas and then include them into our <code>dune</code> file using\n<code>(include dune.inc)</code>.</p>\n<p>To achieve that while keeping things as clean as possible I use the following directory structure:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">test/rewriter/\n\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 errors\n\226\148\130\194\160\194\160 \226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 dune\n\226\148\130\194\160\194\160 \226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 dune.inc\n\226\148\130\194\160\194\160 \226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 gen_dune_rules.ml\n\226\148\130\194\160\194\160 \226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 pp.ml\n\226\148\130\194\160\194\160 \226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 test_some_error.expected\n\226\148\130\194\160\194\160 \226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 test_some_error.ml\n\226\148\130\194\160\194\160 \226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 test_some_other_error.expected\n\226\148\130\194\160\194\160 \226\148\148\226\148\128\226\148\128 test_some_other_error.ml\n\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 dune\n\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 test.expected.ml\n\226\148\156\226\148\128\226\148\128 pp.ml\n\226\148\148\226\148\128\226\148\128 test.ml</code></pre></div>\n<p>Compared to our previous setup, we only added the new <code>errors</code> folder. To keep things simple it has\nits own <code>pp.ml</code> copy but in the future I'd like to improve it a bit and be able to use the same\n<code>pp.exe</code> binary.</p>\n<p>The most important files here are <code>gen_dune_rules.ml</code> and <code>dune.inc</code>. The first is just a simple\nOCaml script to generate the above stanzas for each test cases in the <code>errors</code> directory. The second\nis the file we'll include in the main <code>dune</code>. It's also the file to which we'll write the generated\nstanza.</p>\n<p>I personally use the following <code>gen_dune_rules.ml</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre

just build the list of all the <code>.ml</code> files in the directory except\n<code>pp.ml</code> and <code>gen_dune_rules.ml</code> itself and then generate the right stanzas for each of them. You'll\nnote the extra <code>library</code> stanza which I add to get dune to generate the right <code>.merlin</code> so that I\ncan see the error highlights when I edit the files by hand.</p>\n<p>With that we're almost good, add the following to the <code>dune</code> file and you're all set:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(executable\n  (name pp)\n  (modules pp)\n  (libraries\n    ppx_yojson\n    ppxlib\n  )\n)\n\n(include dune.inc)\n\n(executable\n  (name gen_dune_rules)\n  (modules gen_dune_rules)\n)\n\n(rule\n  (targets dune.inc.gen)\n  (deps\n    (:gen gen_dune_rules.exe)\n    (source_tree .)\n  )\n  (action\n    (with-stdout-to\n      %{targets}\n      (run %{gen})\n    ) \n  )\n)\n\n(alias\n  (name runtest)\n  (action (diff dune.inc dune.inc.gen))\n)</code></pre></div>\n<p>The first stanza is here to specify how to build the rewriter binary, same as before, while the\nsecond stanza just tells dune to include the content of <code>dune.inc</code> within this <code>dune</code> file.</p>\n<p>The interesting part comes next. As you can guess the <code>executable</code> stanza builds our little OCaml\nscript into a <code>.exe</code>. The <code>rule</code> that comes after that specifies how to generate the new stanzas\nby running <code>gen_dune_rules</code> and capturing its standard output into a <code>dune.inc.gen</code> file.\nThe last rule allows you to review the changes to the generated stanza and use promotion to accept\nthem. Once this is done, the new stanzas will be included to the <code>dune</code> file and the test will be\nrun for every test cases.</p>\n<p>Adding a new test case is then pretty easy, you can simply run:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ touch test/rewriter/errors/some_explicit_test_case_name.{ml,expected} &amp;&amp; dune runtest --auto-promote</code></pre></div>\n<p>That will create the new empty test case and update the <code>dune.inc</code> with the corresponding rules.\nFrom there you can proceed the same way as with the successful rewriting tests, update the <code>.ml</code>,\nrun <code>dune runtest</code> to take a sneak peek at the output and <code>dune promote</code> once you're satisfied with\nthe result.</p>\n<p>I've been pretty happy with this setup so far although there's room for improvement. It would be\nnice to avoid duplicating <code>pp.ml</code> for errors testing. This also involves\nquite a bit of boilerplate that I have to copy into all my PPX rewriters repositories every time.\nHopefully <a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/1855\">dune plugins</a> should help with that and I\ncan't wait for a first version to be released so that I can write a plugin to make this test\npattern more accessible and easier to set up.</p>"

A Notty image is matrix of characters with optional styling attributes (tweaking foreground and background colors, using <strong>bold</strong> glyphs...).</p>\n<p>These images are pure values and can be composed (concatenated, cropped, ...) very efficiently, making them very convenient to manipulate in a functional way.</p>\n<p>However these images are inert: their contents are fixed and their only purpose is to be displayed. Nottui reuses Notty images and exposes essentially the same interface but it adds two features: layout &#x26; event dispatch. UI elements now adapt to the space available and can react to keyboard and mouse actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Layout DSL</strong>. Specifying a layout is done using \"stretchable\" dimensions, a concept loosely borrowed from TeX. Each UI element has a fixed size (expressed as a number of columns and rows) and a stretchable size (possibly empty). The stretchable part is interpreted as a strength that is used to determine how to share the space available among all UI elements.</p>\n<p>This is a simple system amenable to an efficient implementation while being powerful enough to express common layout patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Event dispatch</strong>. Reacting to mouse and keyboard events is better done using local behaviors, specific to an element. In Nottui, images are augmented with handlers for common actions. There is also a global notion of focus to determine which element should consume input events.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interactivity-with-lwd\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#interactivity-with-lwd\" aria-label=\"interactivity with lwd permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Interactivity with Lwd</h2>\n<p>Nottui's additions are nice for resizing and attaching behaviors to images, but they are still static objects. In practice, user interfaces are very dynamic: parts can be independently updated to display new information.</p>\n<p>This interactivity layer is brought by Lwd and is developed separately from the core UI library. It is built around a central type, <code>'a Lwd.t</code>, that represents a value of type <code>'a</code> that can change over time.</p>\n<p><code>Lwd.t</code> is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor\">applicative functor</a> (and even a monad), making it a highly composable abstraction.</p>\n<p>Primitive changes are introduced by <code>Lwd.var</code>, which are OCaml references with an extra operation <code>val get : 'a Lwd.var -> 'a Lwd.t</code>. This operation turns a variable into a <em>changing value</em> that changes whenever the variable is set.</p>\n<p>In practice this leads to a mostly declarative style of programming interactive documents (as opposed to the DOM that is deeply mutable). Most of the code is just function applications without spooky action at a distance! However, it is possible to opt-out of this pure style by introducing an <code>Lwd.var</code>, on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-much-more\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#and-much-more\" aria-label=\"and much more permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>And much more...</h2>\n<p>A few extra libraries are provided to target more specific problems.</p>\n<p><code>Lwd_table</code> and <code>Lwd_seq</code> are two datastructures to manipulate dynamic collections. <code>Nottui_pretty</code> is an interactive pretty printing library that supports arbitrary Nottui layouts and widgets.

  ; body_html = "<p>In our <a href=\"https://tarides.com/blog/2019-08-26-decompress-the-new-decompress-api.html\">first article</a> we mostly discussed\nthe API design of <code>decompress</code> and did not talk too much about the issue of\noptimizing performance. In this second article, we will relate our experiences\nof optimizing <code>decompress</code>.</p>\n<p>As you might suspect, <code>decompress</code> needs to be optimized a lot. It was used by\nseveral projects as an underlying layer of some formats (like Git), so it can be\na real bottleneck in those projects. Of course, we start with a footgun by using\na garbage-collected language; comparing the performance of <code>decompress</code> with a C\nimplementation (like <a href=\"https://zlib.net/\">zlib</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/richgel999/miniz\">miniz</a>) is obviously not very fair.</p>\n<p>However, using something like <code>decompress</code> instead of C implementations can be\nvery interesting for many purposes, especially when thinking about <em>unikernels</em>.\nAs we said in the previous article, we can take the advantage of the <em>runtime</em>\nand the type-system to provide something <em>safer</em> (of course, it's not really\ntrue since zlib has received several security audits).</p>\n<p>The main idea in this article is not to give snippets to copy/paste into your\ncodebase but to explain some behaviors of the compiler / runtime and hopefully\ngive you some ideas about how to optimize your own code. We'll discuss the\nfollowing optimizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>specialization</li>\n<li>inlining</li>\n<li>untagged integers</li>\n<li>exceptions</li>\n<li>unrolling</li>\n<li>hot-loop</li>\n<li>caml_modify</li>\n<li>representation sizes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"cautionary-advice\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cautionary-advice\" aria-label=\"cautionary advice permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cautionary advice</h3>\n<p>Before we begin discussing optimization, keep this rule in mind:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only perform optimization at the <strong>end</strong> of the development process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An optimization pass\ncan change your code significantly, so you need to keep a state of your project\nthat can be trusted. This state will provide a comparison point for both\nbenchmarks and behaviors. In other words, your stable implementation will be the\noracle for your benchmarks. If you start with nothing, you'll achieve\narbitrarily-good performance at the cost of arbitrary behavior!</p>\n<p>We optimized <code>decompress</code> because we are using it in bigger projects for a long\ntime (2 years). So we have an oracle (even if <code>zlib</code> can act as an oracle in\nthis special case).</p>\n<h2 id=\"specialization\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#specialization\" aria-label=\"specialization permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Specialization</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest specializations in <code>decompress</code> is regarding the <code>min</code>\nfunction. If you don't know, in OCaml <code>min</code> is polymorphic; you can compare\nanything. So you probably have some concerns about how <code>min</code> is implemented?</p>\n<p>You are right to be concerned: if you examine the details, <code>min</code> calls the C\nfunction <code>do_compare_val</code>, which traverses your structure and does a comparison\naccording the run-time representation of your structure. Of course, for integers, it\nshould be only a <code>cmpq</code> assembly instruction.

This is the goal of <code>flambda</code>: do the right\noptimization under the right context. If you are really curious about what <code>gcc</code>\ndoes and why, even if it's very interesting, the reverse engineering of the\noptimization process and which information is relevant about the choice to\noptimize or not is deep, long and surely too complicated.</p>\n<p>A non-spontaneous optimization is to annotate some parts of your code with\n<code>[@@inline never]</code> \226\128\147 so, explicitly say to the compiler to not inline the\nfunction. This constraint is to help the compiler to generate a smaller code\nwhich will have more chance to fit under the processor cache.</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, <code>[@@inline]</code> should be used sparingly and an oracle to\ncompare performances if you inline or not this or this function is necessary to\navoid a <em>pessimization</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-decompress\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#in-decompress\" aria-label=\"in decompress permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>In <code>decompress</code></h3>\n<p>Inlining in <code>decompress</code> was done on small functions which need to allocate\nto return a value. If we inline them, we can take the opportunity to store\nreturned value in registers (of course, it depends how many registers are free).</p>\n<p>As we said, the goal of the inflator is to translate a bit sequence to a byte.\nThe largest bit sequence possible according to RFC 1951 has length 15. So, when\nwe process an inputs flow, we eat it 15 bits per 15 bits. For each packet, we\nwant to recognize an existing associated bit sequence and then, binded values\nwill be the real length of the bit sequence and the byte:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> find <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> bits<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>int <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> len<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> byte<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>So for each call to this function, we need to allocate a record/tuple. It's\nwhy we choose to inline this function. <code>min</code> was inlined too and some other\nsmall functions. But as we said, the situation is complex; where we think that\n<em>inlining</em> can help us, it's not systematically true.</p>\n<p>NOTE: we can recognize bits sequence with, at most, 15 bits because a\n<a href=\"https://zlib.net/feldspar.html\">Huffman coding</a> is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code\">prefix-free</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"untagged-integers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#untagged-integers\" aria-label=\"untagged integers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Untagged integers</h2>\n<p>When reading assembly, the integer <code>0</code> is written as <code>$1</code>.\nIt's because of the <a href=\"https://blog.janestreet.com/what-is-gained-and-lost-with-63-bit-integers/\">GC bit</a> needed to differentiate a pointer\nand an unboxed integer. This is why, in OCaml, we talk about a 31-bits integer\nor a 63-bits integer (depending on your architecture).</p>\n<p>We will not try to start a debate about this arbitrary choice on the\nrepresentation of an integer in OCaml. However, we can talk about some\noperations which can have an impact on performances.</p>\n<p>The biggest example is about the <code>mod</code> operation. Between OCaml and C, <code>%</code> or\n<code>mod</code> should be the same:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> f a b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">mod</span> b</code></pre></div>\n<p>The output assembly is:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"asm\"><pre class=\"language-asm\"><code class=\"language-asm\">.L105:\n        movq    %rdi, %rcx\n        sarq    $1, %rcx     // b &gt;&gt; 1\n        movq    (%rsp), %rax\n        sarq    $1, %rax     // a &gt;&gt; 1\n        testq   %rcx, %rcx   // b != 0\n        je      .L107\n        cqto\n        idivq   %rcx         // a % b\n        jmp     .L106\n.L107:\n        movq    caml_backtrace_pos@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rax\n        xorq    %rbx, %rbx\n        movl    %ebx, (%rax)\n        movq    caml_exn_Division_by_zero@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rax\n        call    caml_raise_exn@PLT\n.L106:\n        salq    $1, %rdx     // x &lt;&lt; 1\n        incq    %rdx         // x + 1\n        movq    %rbx, %rax</code></pre></div>\n<p>where idiomatically the same C code produce:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"asm\"><pre class=\"language-asm\"><code class=\"language-asm\">.L2:\n        movl    -12(%rbp), %eax\n        cltd\n        idivl   -8(%rbp)\n        movl    %edx, -4(%rbp)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Of course, we can notice firstly the exception in OCaml (<code>Divided_by_zero</code>) -\nwhich is pretty good because it protects us against an interrupt from assembly\n(and keep the trace). Then, we need to <em>untag</em> <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> with <code>sarq</code> assembly\noperation. We do, as the C code, <code>idiv</code> and then we must <em>retag</em> returned value\n<code>x</code> with <code>salq</code> and <code>incq</code>.</p>\n<p>So in some parts, it should be more interesting to use <code>Nativeint</code>. However, by\ndefault, a <code>nativeint</code> is boxed. <em>boxed</em> means that the value is allocated in\nthe OCaml heap alongside a header.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is not what we want so, if our <code>nativeint ref</code> (to have\nside-effect, like <code>x</code>) stay inside a function and then, you return the real\nvalue with the deref <code>!</code> operator, OCaml, by a good planet alignment, can\ndirectly use registers and real integers. So it should be possible to avoid\nthese needed conversions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"readability-versus-performance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#readability-versus-performance\" aria-label=\"readability versus performance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Readability versus performance</h3>\n<p>We use this optimization only in few parts of the code.

Especially that the gain is not very\nbig. But this case show a more troubling problem: loss of readability.</p>\n<p>In fact, we can optimize more and more a code (OCaml or C) but we lost, step by\nstep, readability. You should be afraid by the implementation of <code>strlen</code> for\nexample.

In fact, it's pretty\ncommon for an OCaml developer to break the control-flow with an exception.\nBehind this common design/optimization, it's about calling convention.</p>\n<p>Indeed, choose the <em>jump</em> word to describe OCaml exception is not the best where\nwe don't use <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code>.</p>\n<p>In the details, when you start a code with a <code>try .. with</code>, OCaml saves a <em>trap</em>\nin the stack which contains information about the <code>with</code>, the catcher. Then,\nwhen you <code>raise</code>, you <em>jump</em> directly to this trap and can just discard several\nstack frames (and, by this way, you did not check each return codes).</p>\n<p>In several places and mostly in the <em>hot-loop</em>, we use this <em>pattern</em>. However,\nit completely breaks the control flow and can be error-prone.</p>\n<p>To limit errors and because this pattern is usual, we prefer to use a <em>local</em>\nexception which will be used only inside the function. By this way, we enforce\nthe fact that exception should not (and can not) be caught by something else\nthan inside the function.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\">    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">exception</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Break</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">try</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">while</span> <span class=\"token operator\">!</span>max <span class=\"token operator\">>=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">do</span>\n          <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> bl_count<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">!</span>max<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">!=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">then</span> raise_notrace <span class=\"token module variable\">Break</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> decr max <span class=\"token keyword\">done</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Break</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This code above produce this assembly code:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"asm\"><pre class=\"language-asm\"><code class=\"language-asm\">.L105:\n        pushq   %r14\n        movq    %rsp, %r14\n.L103:\n        cmpq    $3, %rdi              // while !max &gt;= 1\n        jl      .L102\n        movq    -4(%rbx,%rdi,4), %rsi // bl_count,(!max)\n        cmpq    $1, %rsi              // bl_count.(!max) != 0\n        je      .L104\n        movq    %r14, %rsp\n        popq    %r14\n        ret                           // raise_notrace Break\n.L104:\n        addq    $-2, %rdi             // decr max\n        movq    %rdi, 16(%rsp)\n        jmp     .L103</code></pre></div>\n<p>Where the <code>ret</code> is the <code>raise_notrace Break</code>.

An <em>hot-loop</em> is mainly a loop on the most common\noperation in your process. In the context of <code>decompress</code>, the <em>hot-loop</em> is\nabout a repeated translation from bits-sequence to byte(s) from the inputs flow\nto the outputs flow and the window.</p>\n<p>The main idea behind the <em>hot-loop</em> is to initialize all information needed for\nthe translation before to start the <em>hot-loop</em>. Then, it's mostly an imperative\nloop with a <em>pattern-matching</em> which corresponds to the current state of the\nglobal computation.</p>\n<p>In OCaml, we can take this opportunity to use <code>int ref</code> (or <code>nativeint ref</code>), and then, they will be translated into registers (which is the fastest\narea to store something).</p>\n<p>Another deal inside the <em>hot-loop</em> is to avoid any allocation \226\128\147 and it's why we\ntalk about <code>int</code> or <code>nativeint</code>. Indeed, a more complex structure like an option\nwill add a blocker to the garbage collection (a call to <code>caml_call_gc</code>).</p>\n<p>Of course, this kind of design is completely wrong if we think in a functional\nway. However, this is the (biggest?) advantage of OCaml: hide this ugly/hacky\npart inside a functional interface.</p>\n<p>In the API, we talked about a state which represents the <em>inflation</em> (or the\n<em>deflation</em>). At the beginning, the goal is to store into some references\nessentials values like the position into the inputs flow, bits available,\ndictionary, etc. Then, we launch the <em>hot-loop</em> and only at the end, we update the state.</p>\n<p>So we keep the optimal design about <em>inflation</em> and the functional way outside\nthe <em>hot-loop</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caml_modify\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#caml_modify\" aria-label=\"caml_modify permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>caml_modify</h2>\n<p>One issue that we need to consider is the call to <code>caml_modify</code>. In\nfact, for a complex data-structure like an <code>int array</code> or a <code>int option</code> (so,\nother than an integer or a boolean or an <em>immediate</em> value), values can move to the\nmajor heap.</p>\n<p>In this context, <code>caml_modify</code> is used to assign a new value into your mutable\nblock. It is a bit slower than a simple assignment but needed to\nensure pointer correspondence between minor heap and major heap.</p>\n<p>With this OCaml code for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> t <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">mutable</span> v <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> int option <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> f t v <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> t<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>v <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;-</span> v</code></pre></div>\n<p>We produce this assembly:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"asm\"><pre class=\"language-asm\"><code class=\"language-asm\">camlExample__f_1004:\n        subq    $8, %rsp\n        movq    %rax, %rdi\n        movq    %rbx, %rsi\n        call    caml_modify@PLT\n        movq    $1, %rax\n        addq    $8, %rsp\n        ret</code></pre></div>\n<p>Where we see the call to <code>caml_modify</code> which will be take care about the\nassignment of <code>v</code> into <code>t.v</code>.

So, for many values in the\n<em>inflator</em> and the <em>deflator</em>, we mostly use integers.</p>\n<p>Of course, at some points, we use <code>int array</code> and set them at some specific\npoints of the <em>inflator</em> \226\128\147 where we inflated the dictionary. However, the impact\nof <code>caml_modify</code> is not very clear where it is commonly pretty fast.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, it can be a real bottleneck in your computation and\nthis depends on how long your values live in the heap.

More generally, the choice of type to represent your values can have\nsignificant performance implications.</p>\n<p>For example, a dictionary which associates a bits-sequence (an integer) to the\nlength of it <strong>AND</strong> the byte, it can be represented by a: <code>(int * int) array</code>, or\nmore idiomatically <code>{ len: int; byte: int; } array</code> (which is structurally the\nsame).</p>\n<p>However, that means an allocation for each bytes to represent every bytes.\nExtraction of it will need an allocation if <code>find : bits:int -> { len: int; byte: int; }</code> is not inlined as we said. And about memory, the array can be\nreally <em>heavy</em> in your heap.</p>\n<p>At this point, we used <code>spacetime</code> to show how many blocks we allocated for a\ncommon <em>inflation</em> and we saw that we allocate a lot. The choice was made to use\na smaller representation. Where <code>len</code> can not be upper than 15 according RFC 1951\nand when byte can represent only 256 possibilities (and should fit under one\nbyte), we can decide to merge them into one integer (which can have, at least,\n31 bits).</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> static_literal_tree <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">140</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">76</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> static_literal_tree <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>map <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">fun</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>len<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> byte<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>len <span class=\"token operator\">lsl</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">lor</span> byte<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> static_literal_tree</code></pre></div>\n<p>In the code above, we just translate the static dictionary (for a STATIC DEFLATE\nblock) to a smaller representation where <code>len</code> will be the left part of the\ninteger and <code>byte</code> will be the right part.

The points highlighted in this\narticle may not fit your particular problem, but they are intended to give you\nideas. Our optimizations were only possible because we completely assimilated\nthe ideas of <code>zlib</code> and had a clear vision of what we really needed to\noptimize (like <code>blit</code>).\n<br/><br/>\nAs your first project, this article can not help you a lot to optimize your\ncode where it's mostly about <em>micro</em>-optimization under a specific context\n(<em>hot-loop</em>). But it helps you to understand what is really done by the\ncompiler \226\128\147 which is still really interesting.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise only with respect to an oracle</strong>. All optimizations were done\nbecause we did a comparison point between the old implementation of\n<code>decompress</code> and <code>zlib</code> as oracles. Optimizations can change the semantics of your\ncode and you should systematically take care at any step about expected\nbehaviors. So it's a long run.</li>\n<li><strong>Use the predictability of the OCaml compiler to your advantage</strong>. For sure,\nthe compiler does not optimize a lot your code \226\128\147 but it sill produce realistic\nprograms if we think about performance. For many cases, <strong>you don't need</strong> to\noptimize your OCaml code. And the good point is about expected behavior.\n<br/><br/>\nThe mind-link between the OCaml and the assembly exists (much more than the C\nand the assembly sometimes where we let the C compiler to optimize the code).\nThe cool fact is to keep a mental-model about what is going on on your code\neasily without to be afraid by what the compiler can produce. And, in some\ncritical parts like <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/eqaf\">eqaf</a>, it's really needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have not discussed benchmarking, which is another hard issue: who should you\ncompare with? where? how? For example, a global comparison between <code>zlib</code> and\n<code>decompress</code> is not very relevant in many ways \226\128\147 especially because of the\ngarbage collector. This could be another article!</p>\n<p>Finally, all of these optimizations should be done by <code>flambda</code>; the difference\nbetween compiling <code>decompress</code> with or without <code>flambda</code> is not very big. We\noptimized <code>decompress</code> by hand mostly to keep compatibility with OCaml (since\n<code>flambda</code> needs another switch) and, in this way, to gain an understanding of\n<code>flambda</code> optimizations so that we can use it effectively!</p>"

Indeed,\nwhen you launch your Linux kernel, it inflates itself according <a href=\"https://zlib.net/\">zlib</a>\nstandard, a superset of RFC 1951. Being a widely-used standard, we decided to\nproduce an OCaml implementation. In the process, we learned many lessons about\ndeveloping OCaml where we would normally use C. So, we are glad to present\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/decompress\"><code>decompress</code></a>.</p>\n<p>One of the many users of RFC 1951 is <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a>, which uses it to pack data\nobjects into a <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles\">PACK file</a>. At the request of <a href=\"https://github.com/samoht\">@samoht</a>,\n<code>decompress</code> appeared some years ago as a Mirage-compatible replacement for zlib\nto be used for compiling a <a href=\"https://mirage.io/\">MirageOS</a> unikernel with\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/\">ocaml-git</a>. Today, this little project passes a major release with\nsubstantial improvements in several domains.</p>\n<p><code>decompress</code> provides an API for inflating and deflating <em>flows</em><code>[1]</code>. The main\ngoal is to provide a <em>platform-agnostic</em> library: one which may be compiled on\nany platform, including JavaScript. We surely cannot be faster than C\nimplementations like <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/zstd\">zstd</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/lz4/lz4\">lz4</a>, but we can play some\noptimisation tricks to help bridge the gap. Additionally, OCaml can protect the\nuser against lot of bugs via the type-system <em>and</em> the runtime too (e.g. using\narray bounds checking). <a href=\"https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls\"><code>ocaml-tls</code></a> was implemented partly in\nresponse to the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed\">failure</a> of <code>openssl</code>; a vulnerability\nwhich could not exist in OCaml.</p>\n<p><code>[1]</code>: A <em>flow</em>, in MirageOS land, is an abstraction which wants to receive\nand/or transmit something under a standard. So it's usual to say a <em>TLS-flow</em>\nfor example.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api-design\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#api-design\" aria-label=\"api design permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>API design</h2>\n<p>The API should be the most difficult part of designing a library - it reveals\nwhat we can do and how we should do it. In this way, an API should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>constrain the user to avoid security issues</strong>; too much freedom can be a bad\nthing. As an example, consider the <code>Hashtbl.create</code> function, which allows the\nuser to pass <code>~random:false</code> to select a fixed hash function. The resulting\nhashtable suffers deterministic key collisions, which can be exploited by an\nattacker.\n<br/><br/>\nAn example of good security-awareness in API design can be seen in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/digestif\">digestif</a>, which provided an <code>unsafe_compare</code> instead of the common\n<code>compare</code> function (before <code>eqaf.0.5</code>). In this way, it enforced the user to\ncreate an alias of it if they want to use a hash in a <code>Map</code> \226\128\147 however, by this\naction, they should know that they are not protected against a timing-attack.</li>\n<li><strong>allow some degrees of freedom to fit within many environments</strong>; a\nconstrained API cannot support a hostile context. For example, when compiling\nto an <a href=\"https://mirage.io/blog/2018-esp32-booting\">ESP32</a> target, even small details such as the length of a stream\ninput buffer must be user-definable. When deploying to a server, memory\nconsumption should be deterministic.\n<br/><br/>\nOf course, this is made difficult when too much freedom will enable misuse of\nthe API \226\128\147 an example is <a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml/dune\">dune</a> which wants consciously to limit the user\nabout what they can do with it.</li>\n<li><strong>imply an optimal design of how to use it</strong>. Possibilities should serve the\nuser, but these can make the API harder to understand; this is why\ndocumentation is important. Your API should tell your users how it wants to\nbe treated.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"a-dbuenzli-api\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-dbuenzli-api\" aria-label=\"a dbuenzli api permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A dbuenzli API</h3>\n<p>From our experiences with protocol/format, one design stands out: the\n<em><a href=\"https://github.com/dbuenzli/\">dbuenzli</a> API</em>. If you look into some famous libraries in the OCaml\neco-system, you probably know <a href=\"https://github.com/dbuenzli/uutf\">uutf</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dbuenzli/jsonm\">jsonm</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/dbuenzli/xmlm\">xmlm</a>. All\nof these libraries provide the same API for computing a Unicode/JSON/XML flow \226\128\147\nof course, the details are not the same.</p>\n<p>From a MirageOS perspective, even if they use the <code>in_channel</code>/<code>out_channel</code>\nabstraction rather than a <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/mirage-flow\">Mirage flow</a>, these libraries\nare system-agnostic since they let the user to choose input and output buffers.\nMost importantly, they don't use the standard OCaml <code>Unix</code> module, which cannot\nbe used in a unikernel.</p>\n<p>The APIs are pretty consistent and try to do their <em>best-effort</em><code>[2]</code> of\ndecoding. The design has a type <em>state</em> which represents the current system\nstatus; the user passes this to <code>decode</code>/<code>encode</code> to carry out the processing.\nOf course, these functions have a side-effect on the state internally, but\nthis is hidden from the user. One advantage of including states in a design is\nthat the underlying implementation is very amenable to compiler optimisations (e.g.\ntail-call optimisation). Internally, of course, we have a <em>porcelain</em><code>[3]</code>\nimplementation where any details can have an rational explanation.</p>\n<p>In the beginning, <code>decompress</code> wanted to follow the same interface without the\nmutability (a choice about performances) and it did. Then, the hard test was to\nuse it in a bigger project; in this case, <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/\">ocaml-git</a>.

The most common byte is assigned the shortest bit\nsequence; less common bytes are assigned longer codewords. Using this\ndictionary, we just translate each byte into its codeword and we should achieve\na good compression ratio. Of course, there are other details, such as the fact\nthat all Huffman codes are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code\">prefix-free</a>. The compression can be\ntaken further with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78\">LZ77</a> algorithm.</p>\n<p>The <em><a href=\"https://zlib.net/\">zlib</a></em> format, a superset of the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951\">RFC 1951</a> format, is easy\nto understand. We will only consider the RFC 1951 format, since zlib adds only\nminor details (such as checksums). It consists of several blocks: DEFLATE\nblocks, each with a little header, and the contents. There are 3 kinds of\nDEFLATE blocks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a FLAT block; no compression, just a <em>blit</em> from inputs to the current block.</li>\n<li>a FIXED block; compressed using a pre-computed Huffman code.</li>\n<li>a DYNAMIC block; compressed using a user-specified Huffman code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The FIXED block uses a Huffman dictionary that is computed when the OCaml runtime\nis initialised. DYNAMIC blocks use dictionaries specified by the user, and so\nthese must be transmitted alongside the data (<em>after being compressed with\nanother Huffman code!</em>). The inflator decompresses this DYNAMIC dictionary and uses\nit to do the <em>reverse</em> translation from bit sequences to bytes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inflator\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#inflator\" aria-label=\"inflator permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Inflator</h3>\n<p>The design of the inflator did not change a lot from the last version of\n<code>decompress</code>. Indeed, it's about to take an input, compute it and return an\noutput like a flow. Of course, the error case can be reached.</p>\n<p>So the API is pretty-easy:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> decode <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> decoder <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Await</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Flush</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`End</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Malformed</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> string <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>As you can see, we have 4 cases: one which expects more inputs (<code>Await</code>), the\nsecond which asks to the user to flush internal buffer (<code>Flush</code>), the <code>End</code> case\nwhen we reach the end of the flow and the <code>Malformed</code> case when we encounter an\nerror.</p>\n<p>For each case, the user can do several operations. Of course, about the <code>Await</code>\ncase, they can refill the contents with an other inputs buffer with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> src <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> decoder <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> bigstring <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> off<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>int <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> len<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>int <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> unit</code></pre></div>\n<p>This function provides the decoder a new input with <code>len</code> bytes to read\nstarting at <code>off</code> in the given <code>bigstring</code>.</p>\n<p>In the <code>Flush</code> case, the user wants some information like how many bytes are\navailable in the current output buffer. Then, we should provide an action to\n<em>flush</em> this output buffer. In the end, this output buffer should be given by\nthe user (how many bytes they want to allocate to store outputs flow).</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> src <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Channel</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> in_channel <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Manual</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`String</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> string <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> dst_rem <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> decoder <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> int\n<span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> flush <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> decoder <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> unit\n<span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> decoder <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> src <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> o<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>bigstring <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> w<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>bigstring <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> decoder</code></pre></div>\n<p>The last function, <code>decoder</code>, is the most interesting. It lets the user, at the\nbeginning, choose the context in which they want to inflate inputs. So they\nchoose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>src</code>, where come from inputs flow</li>\n<li><code>o</code>, output buffer</li>\n<li><code>w</code>, window buffer</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>o</code> will be used to store inflated outputs, <code>dst_rem</code> will give to us how many\nbytes inflator stored in <code>o</code> and <code>flush</code> will just set <code>decoder</code> to be able to\nrecompute the flow.</p>\n<p><code>w</code> is needed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78\">lz77</a> compression. However, as we said, we let\nthe user give us this intermediate buffer. The idea behind that is to let the\nuser prepare an <em>inflation</em>. For example, in <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/\">ocaml-git</a>, instead of\nallocating <code>w</code> systematically when we want to decompress a Git object, we\nallocate <code>w</code> one time per threads and all are able to use it and <strong>re-use</strong> it.\nIn this way, we avoid systematic allocations (and allocate only once time) which\ncan have a serious impact about performances.</p>\n<p>The design is pretty close to one idea, a <em>description</em> step by the <code>decoder</code>\nfunction and a real computation loop with the <code>decode</code> function. The idea is to\nprepare the inflation with some information (like <code>w</code> and <code>o</code>) before the main\n(and the most expensive) computation. Internally we do that too (but it's mostly\nabout a macro-optimization).</p>\n<p>It's the purpose of OCaml in general, be able to have a powerful way to describe\nsomething (with constraints). In our case, we are very limited to what we need\nto describe. But, in others libraries like <a href=\"https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom\">angstrom</a>, the description\nstep is huge (describe the parser according to the BNF) and then, we use it to\nthe main computation, in the case of angstrom, the parsing (another\nexample is [cmdliner][cmdliner]).</p>\n<p>This is why <code>decoder</code> can be considered as the main function where <code>decode</code> can\nbe wrapped under a stream.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deflator\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#deflator\" aria-label=\"deflator permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Deflator</h3>\n<p>The deflator is a new (complex) deal.

However, the indirection of a functor comes with (big)\nperformance cost.

As we learned from <a href=\"https://github.com/chambart\">Pierre Chambart</a>, it is possible\nfor the OCaml compiler to optimize functors directly, but this requires\nrespecting several constraints that are difficult to respect in practice.</p>\n<h4 id=\"split-encoder-and-compressor\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#split-encoder-and-compressor\" aria-label=\"split encoder and compressor permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Split encoder and compressor</h4>\n<p>So, the choice was done to made the encoder which respects RFC 1951 and the\ncompressor under some constraints. However, this is not what <a href=\"https://zlib.net/\">zlib</a> did\nand, by this way, we decided to provide a new design/API which did not follow,\nin first instance, zlib (or some others implementations like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/richgel999/miniz\">miniz</a>).</p>\n<p>To be fair, the choice from zlib and miniz comes from the first\npoint about API and the context where they are used. The main problem is the\nshared queue between the encoder and the compressor. In C code, it can be hard\nfor the user to deal with it (where they are liable for buffer overflows).</p>\n<p>In OCaml and for <code>decompress</code>, the shared queue can be well-abstracted and API\ncan ensure assumptions (like bounds checking).</p>\n<p>Even if this design is much more complex than before, coverage tests are better\nwhere we can separately test the encoder and the compressor. It breaks down the\ninitial black-box where compression was intrinsec with encoding \226\128\147 which was\nerror-prone. Indeed, <code>decompress</code> had a bug about generation of\nHuffman codes but we never reached it because the (bad)\ncompressor was not able to produce something (a specific lengh with a specific\ndistance) to get it.</p>\n<p>NOTE: you have just read the main reason for the new version of <code>decompress</code>!</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-compressor\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-compressor\" aria-label=\"the compressor permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The compressor</h4>\n<p>The compressor is the most easy part. The goal is to produce from an inputs\nflow, an outputs flow which is an other (more compacted) representation. This\nrepresentation consists to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <em>literal</em>, the byte as is</li>\n<li>A <em>copy</em> code with an <em>offset</em> and a <em>length</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last one say to copy <em>length</em> byte(s) from <em>offset</em>. For example, <code>aaaa</code> can\nbe compressed as <code>[ Literal 'a'; Copy (offset:1, len:3) ]</code>. By this way, instead\nto have 4 bytes, we have only 2 elements which will be compressed then by an\n<a href=\"https://zlib.net/feldspar.html\">Huffman coding</a>. This is the main idea of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78\">lz77</a>\ncompression.</p>\n<p>However, the compressor should need to deal with the encoder. An easy interface,\n<em>\195\160 la <a href=\"https://github.com/dbuenzli/uutf\">uutf</a></em> should be:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> compress <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> state <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Literal</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> char <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Copy</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>int <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> int<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`End</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Await</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>But as I said, we need to feed a queue instead.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At this point, the purpose of the queue is not clear and not really explained.\nThe signature above still is a valid and understandable design. Then, we can\nimagine passing <code>Literal</code> and <code>Copy</code> directly to the encoder. However, we should\n(for performance purpose) use a delaying tactic between the compressor and the\ndeflator<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Behind this idea, it's to be able to implement an <em>hot-loop</em> on the encoder\nwhich will iter inside the shared queue and <em>transmit</em>/<em>encode</em> contents\ndirectly to the outputs buffer.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, when we make a new <code>state</code>, we let the user supply their queue:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">val state : src -&gt; w:bistring -&gt; q:queue -&gt; state\nval compress : state -&gt; [ `Flush | `Await | `End ]</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>Flush</code> case appears when the queue is full. Then, we refind the <code>w</code> window\nbuffer which is needed to produce the <code>Copy</code> code. A <em>copy code</em> is limited\naccording RFC 1951 where <em>offset</em> can not be upper than the length of the window\n(commonly 32ko). <em>length</em> is limited too to <code>258</code> (an arbitrary choice).</p>\n<p>Of course, about the <code>Await</code> case, the compressor comes with a <code>src</code> function as\nthe inflator. Then, we added some accessors, <code>literals</code> and <code>distances</code>. The\ncompressor does not build the <a href=\"https://zlib.net/feldspar.html\">Huffman coding</a> which needs\nfrequencies, so we need firstly to keep counters about that inside the state and\na way to get them (and pass them to the encoder).</p>\n<p><code>[4]</code>: About that, you should be interesting by the reason of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unix/comments/6gxduc/how_is_gnu_yes_so_fast/\">why GNU yes is so\nfast</a> where the secret is just about buffering.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-encoder\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-encoder\" aria-label=\"the encoder permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The encoder</h4>\n<p>Finally, we can talk about the encoder which will take the shared queue filled\nby the compressor and provide an RFC 1951 compliant output flow.</p>\n<p>However, we need to consider a special <em>detail</em>. When we want to make a\nDYNAMIC block from frequencies and then encode the inputs flow, we can reach a\ncase where the shared queue contains an <em>opcode</em> (a <em>literal</em> or a <em>copy</em>) which\ndoes not appear in our dictionary.</p>\n<p>In fact, if we want to encode <code>[ Literal 'a'; Literal 'b' ]</code>, we will not try to\nmake a dictionary which will contains the 256 possibilities of a byte but we\nwill only make a dictionary from frequencies which contains only <code>'a'</code> and\n<code>'b'</code>. By this way, we can reach a case where the queue contains an <em>opcode</em>\n(like <code>Literal 'c'</code>) which can not be encoded by the <em>pre-determined</em>\nHuffman coding \226\128\147 remember, the DYNAMIC block <strong>starts</strong> with\nthe dictionary.</p>\n<p>Another point is about inputs. The encoder expects, of course, contents from\nthe shared queue but it wants from the user the way to encode contents: which\nblock we want to emit. So it has two entries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the shared queue</li>\n<li>an <em>user-entry</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So for many real tests, we decided to provide this kind of API:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> dst <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Channel</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> out_channel <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Buffer</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Buffer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>t <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Manual</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> encoder <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> dst <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> q<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>queue <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> encoder\n<span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> encode <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> encoder <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Block</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">of</span> block <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Flush</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Await</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Ok</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Partial</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token variant variable\">`Block</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> dst <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> encoder <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> bigstring <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> off<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>int <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> len<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>int <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> unit</code></pre></div>\n<p>As expected, we take the shared queue to make a new encoder. Then, we let the\nuser to specify which kind of block they want to encode by the <code>Block</code>\noperation.</p>\n<p>The <code>Flush</code> operation tries to encode all elements present inside the shared\nqueue according to the current block and feed the outputs buffer. From it, the\nencoder can returns some values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Ok</code> and the encoder encoded all <em>opcode</em> from the shared queue</li>\n<li><code>Partial</code>, the outputs buffer is not enough to encode all <em>opcode</em>, the user\nshould flush it and give to us a new empty buffer with <code>dst</code>. Then, they must\ncontinue with the <code>Await</code> operation.</li>\n<li><code>Block</code>, the encoder reachs an <em>opcode</em> which can not be encoded with the\ncurrent block (the current dictionary). Then, the user must continue with a new\n<code>Block</code> operation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The hard part is about the <em>ping-pong</em> game between the user and the encoder\nwhere a <code>Block</code> expects a <code>Block</code> response from the user and a <code>Partial</code> expects\nan <code>Await</code> response. But this design reveals something higher about zlib\nthis time: the <em>flush</em> mode.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-flush-mode\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-flush-mode\" aria-label=\"the flush mode permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The <em>flush</em> mode</h4>\n<p>Firstly, we talk about <em>mode</em> because zlib does not allow the user to\ndecide what they want to do when we reach a <code>Block</code> or a <code>Ok</code> case. So, it\ndefines some <a href=\"https://www.bolet.org/~pornin/deflate-flush.html\">under-specified <em>modes</em></a> to apply a policy of what\nto do in this case.</p>\n<p>In <code>decompress</code>, we followed the same design and see that it may be not a good\nidea where the logic is not very clear and the user wants may be an another\nbehavior. It was like a <em>black-box</em> with a <em>black-magic</em>.</p>\n<p>Because we decided to split encoder and compressor, the idea of the <em>flush mode</em>\ndoes not exists anymore where the user explicitly needs to give to the encoder\nwhat they want (make a new block? which block? keep frequencies?). So we broke\nthe <em>black-box</em>. But, as we said, it was possible mostly because we can abstract\nsafely the shared queue between the compressor and the encoder.</p>\n<p>OCaml is an expressive language and we can really talk about a queue where, in\nC, it will be just an other <em>array</em>. As we said, the deal is about performance,\nbut now, we allow the user the possibility to write their code in this corner-case\nwhich is when they reachs <code>Block</code>. Behaviors depends only on them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apis-in-general\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#apis-in-general\" aria-label=\"apis in general permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>APIs in general</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge of building a library is defining the API - you must\nstrike a compromise between allowing the user the flexibility to express their\nuse-case and constraining the user to avoid API misuse. If at all possible,\nprovide an <em>intuitive</em> API: force the user not to need to think about security\nissues, memory consumption or performance.</p>\n<p>Avoid making your API so expressive that it becomes unusable, but beware that\nthis sets hard limits on your users: the current <code>decompress</code> API can be used to\nbuild <code>of_string</code> / <code>to_string</code> functions, but the opposite is not true - you\ndefinitely cannot build a stream API from <code>of_string</code> / <code>to_string</code>.</p>\n<p>The best advice when designing a library is to keep in mind what you <strong>really</strong>\nwant and let the other details fall into place gradually. It is very important\nto work in an iterative loop of repeatedly trying to use your library; only this\ncan highlight bad design, corner-cases and details.</p>\n<p>Finally, use and re-use it on your tests (important!) and inside higher-level\nprojects to give you interesting questions about your design. The last version\nof <code>decompress</code> was not used in <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/\">ocaml-git</a> mostly because the flush\nmode was unclear.</p>"

This feature allows to\nmark some abstract library as virtual, and then have several\nimplementations for it. These implementations could be for multiple\ntargets (<code>unix</code>, <code>xen</code>, <code>js</code>), using different algorithms, using C\ncode or not. However each implementation in a project dependency tree\nhad to be manually selected. Dune 1.9.0 introduces features for\nautomatic selection of implementations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"library-variants\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#library-variants\" aria-label=\"library variants permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Library variants</h2>\n<p>Variants is a tagging mechanism to select implementations on the final\nlinking step. There's not much to add to make your implementation use\nvariants. For example, you could decide to design a <code>bar_js</code> library\nwhich is the javascript implementation of <code>bar</code>, a virtual\nlibrary. All you need to do is specificy a <code>js</code> tag using the\n<code>variant</code> option.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(library\n (name bar_js)\n (implements bar)\n (variant js)); &lt;-- variant specification</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now any executable that depend on <code>bar</code> can automatically select the\n<code>bar_js</code> library variant using the <code>variants</code> option in the dune file.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(executable\n (name foo)\n (libraries bar baz)\n (variants js));

In this post, we'll\ngive a brief tour of what these sub-trees will bring for the future of Tezos.\nBut first, what <em>are</em> they?</p>\n<h3 id=\"merkle-sub-trees\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#merkle-sub-trees\" aria-label=\"merkle sub trees permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Merkle sub-trees</h3>\n<p>The Tezos protocol runs on top of a versioned tree called the \226\128\156context\226\128\157, which\nholds the chain state (balances, contracts etc.).

  ; body_html = "<p><a href=\"https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/\">AFL</a> (and fuzzing in general) is often used\nto find bugs in low-level code like parsers, but it also works very well to find\nbugs in high level code, provided the right ingredients. We applied this\ntechnique to feed random programs to OCamlFormat and found many formatting bugs.</p>\n<p>OCamlFormat is a tool to format source code. To do so, it parses the source code\nto an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then applies formatting rules to the AST.</p>\n<p>It can be tricky to correctly format the output. For example, say we want to\nformat <code>(a+b)*c</code>. The corresponding AST will look like <code>Apply(\"*\", Apply (\"+\", Var \"a\", Var \"b\"), Var \"c\")</code>. A naive formatter would look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">rec</span> format <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Var</span> s <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> s\n  <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Apply</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>op<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> e1<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> e2<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span>\n      <span class=\"token module variable\">Printf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sprintf <span class=\"token string\">\"%s %s %s\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>format e1<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> op <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>format e2<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>But this is not correct, as it will print <code>(a+b)*c</code> as <code>a+b*c</code>, which is a\ndifferent program. In this particular case, the common solution would be to\ntrack the relative precedence of the expressions and to emit only necessary\nparentheses.</p>\n<p>OCamlFormat has similar cases. To make sure we do not change a program when\nformatting it, there is an extra check at the end to parse the output and\ncompare the output AST with the input AST. This ensures that, in case of bugs,\nOCamlFormat exits with an error rather than changing the meaning of the input\nprogram.</p>\n<p>When we consider the whole OCaml language, the rules are complex and it is\ndifficult to make sure that we are correctly handling all programs. There are\ntwo main failure modes: either we put too many parentheses, and the program does\nnot look good, or we do not put enough, and the AST changes (and OCamlFormat\nexits with an error). We need a way to make sure that the latter does not\nhappen. Tests work to some extent, but some edge cases happen only when a\ncertain combination of language features is used. Because of this combinatorial\nexplosion, it is impossible to get good coverage using tests only.</p>\n<p>Fortunately there is a technique we can use to automatically explore the program\nspace: fuzzing. For a primer on using this technique on OCaml programs, one can\nrefer to <a href=\"https://tarides.com/blog/2019-09-04-an-introduction-to-fuzzing-ocaml-with-afl-crowbar-and-bun\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>To make this work we need two elements: a random program generator, and a\nproperty to check. Here, we are interested in programs that are valid (in the\nsense that they parse correctly) but do not format correctly. We can use the\nOCamlFormat internals to do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>try to parse input: in case of a parse error, just reject this input as\ninvalid.</li>\n<li>otherwise, with have a valid program. try to format it. If this happens with\nno error at all, reject this input as well.</li>\n<li>otherwise, it means that the AST changed, comments moved, or something\nsimilar, in a valid program. This is what we are after.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Generating random programs is a bit more difficult. We can feed random strings\nto AFL, but even with a corpus of existing valid code it will generate many\ninvalid programs. We are not interested in these for this project, we would\nrather start from valid programs.</p>\n<p>A good way to do that is to use Crowbar to directly generate AST values. Thanks\nto <a href=\"https://github.com/yomimono/ppx_deriving_crowbar\"><code>ppx_deriving_crowbar</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_import\"><code>ppx_import</code></a>\nit is possible to generate random values for an external type like\n<code>Parsetree.structure</code> (the contents of <code>.ml</code> files). Even more fortunately\n<a href=\"https://github.com/yomimono/ocaml-test-omp/blob/d086037027537ba4e23ce027766187979c85aa3d/test/parsetree_405.ml\">somebody already did the work</a>. Thanks, Mindy!</p>\n<p>This approach works really well: it generates 5k-10k programs per second, which\nis very good performance (AFL starts complaining below 100/s).</p>\n<p>Quickly, AFL was able to find crashes related to attributes. These are \"labels\"\nattached to various nodes of the AST. For example the expression <code>(x || y) [@a]</code>\n(logical or between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, attach attribute <code>a</code> to the \"or\" expression)\nwould get formatted as <code>x || y [@a]</code> (attribute <code>a</code> is attached to the <code>y</code>\nvariable). Once again, there is a check in place in OCamlFormat to make sure\nthat it does not save the file in this case, but it would exit with an error.</p>\n<p>After the fuzzer has run for a bit longer, it found crashes where comments would\njump around in expressions like <code>f (*a*) (*bb*) x</code>. Wait, what? We never told\nthe program generator how to generate comments. Inspecting the intermediate AST,\nthe part in the middle is actually an integer literal with value <code>\"(*a*) (*bb*)\"</code> (integer literals are represented as strings so that <a href=\"https://github.com/Drup/Zarith-ppx\">a third party\nlibrary could add literals for arbitrary precision numbers</a> for\nexample).</p>\n<p>AFL comes with a program called <code>afl-tmin</code> that is used to minimize a crash. It\nwill try to find a smaller example of a program that crashes OCamlFormat. It\nworks well even with Crowbar in between. For example it is able to turn <code>(new aaaaaa &#x26; [0;0;0;0])[@aaaaaaaaaa]</code> into <code>(0&#x26;0)[@a]</code> (neither AFL nor OCamlFormat\nknows about types, so they can operate on nonsensical programs. Finding a\nwell-typed version of a crash is usually not very difficult, but it has to be\ndone manually).</p>\n<p>In total, letting AFL run overnight on a single core (that is relatively short\nin terms of fuzzing) caused 453 crashes. After minimization and deduplication,\nthis corresponded to <a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat/issues?q=label%3Afuzz\">about 30 unique issues</a>.</p>\n<p>Most of them are related to attributes that OCamlFormat did not try to include\nin the output, or where it forgot to add parentheses. Fortunately, there are\nsafeguards in OCamlFormat: since it checks that the formatting preserves the AST\nstructure, it will exit with an error instead of outputting a different program.</p>\n<p>Once again, fuzzing has proved itself as a powerful technique to find actual\nbugs (including high-level ones). A possible approach for a next iteration is to\ntry to detect more problems during formatting, such as finding cases where lines\nare longer than allowed. It is also possible to extend the random program\ngenerator so that it tries to generate comments, and let OCamlFormat check that\nthey are all laid out correctly in the output. We look forward to employing\nfuzzing more extensively for OCamlFormat development in future.</p>"

It reduces disk usage by a factor of 10, while still\nensuring similar performance and consistency guarantees in a memory-constrained\nand concurrent environment.</p>\n<p><code>irmin-pack</code> was presented along with Irmin v2 at the OCaml workshop 2020; you\ncan watch the presentation here:</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%\">\n  <iframe \n    style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0; right: 0\"\n    src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v1lfMUM332w\" frameborder=\"0\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n    allowfullscreen>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"general-structure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#general-structure\" aria-label=\"general structure permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>General structure</h2>\n<p><code>irmin-pack</code> exposes functors that allow the user to provide arbitrary low-level\nmodules for handling I/O, and provides a fast key-value store interface composed\nof three components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>pack</code> is used to store the data contained in the Irmin store, as blobs.</li>\n<li>The <code>dict</code> stores the paths where these blobs should live.</li>\n<li>The <code>index</code> keeps track of the blobs that are present in the repository by\ncontaining location information in the <code>pack</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these use both on-disk storage for persistence and concurrence and\nvarious in-memory caches for speed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"storing-the-data-in-the-pack-file\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#storing-the-data-in-the-pack-file\" aria-label=\"storing the data in the pack file permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Storing the data in the <code>pack</code> file</h3>\n<p>The <code>pack</code> contains most of the data stored in this Irmin backend.

In fact, nodes might contain an\narbitrarily large number of children, and serializing them as a long list of\nreferences might harm performance, as that means loading and writing a large\namount of data for each modification, no matter how small this modification\nmight be. Similarly, browsing the tree means reading large blocks of data, even\nthough only one child is needed.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we implemented a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree\">Patricia Tree</a> representation of\ninternal nodes that allows us to split the child list into smaller parts that\ncan be accessed and modified independently, while still being quickly available\nwhen needed. This reduces duplication of tree data in the Irmin store and\nimproves disk access times.</p>\n<p>Of course, we provide a custom hashing mechanism, so that hashing the nodes\nusing this partitioning is still backwards-compatible for users who rely on hash\ninformation regardless of whether the node is split or not.</p>\n<h4 id=\"optimizing-internal-references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#optimizing-internal-references\" aria-label=\"optimizing internal references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Optimizing internal references</h4>\n<p>In the Git model, all data are content-addressable (i.e. data are always\nreferenced by their hash). This naturally lends to indexing data by hashes on\nthe disk itself (i.e. the links from <code>commits</code> to <code>nodes</code> and from <code>nodes</code> to\n<code>nodes</code> or <code>contents</code> are realized by hash).</p>\n<p>We did not comply to this approach in <code>irmin-pack</code>, for at least two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Referencing by hash does not allow fast recovery of the children, since\nthere is no way to find the relevant blob directly in the <code>pack</code> by providing\nthe hash. We will go into the details of this later in this post.</li>\n<li>While hashes are being used as simple objects, their size is not negligible.\nThe default hashing function in Irmin is BLAKE2B, which provides 64-byte\ndigests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, our internal links in the <code>pack</code> file are concretized by the offsets \226\128\147\n<code>int64</code> integers \226\128\147 of the children instead of their hash. Provided that the\ntrees are always written bottom-up (so that children already exist in the <code>pack</code>\nwhen their parents are written), this solves both issues above. The data handled\nby the backend is always immutable, and the file is append-only, ensuring that\nthe links can never be broken.</p>\n<p>Of course, that encoding does not break the content-addressable property: one\ncan always retrieve an arbitrary piece of data through its hash, but it allows\ninternal links to avoid that indirection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deduplicating-the-path-names-through-the-dict\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#deduplicating-the-path-names-through-the-dict\" aria-label=\"deduplicating the path names through the dict permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Deduplicating the path names through the <code>dict</code></h3>\n<p>In fact, the most common operations when using <code>irmin-pack</code> consist of modifying\nthe tree's leaves rather then its shape. This is similar to the way most of us\nuse Git: modifying the contents of files is very frequent, while renaming or\nadding new files is rather rare. Even still, when writing a <code>node</code> in a new\ncommit, that node must contain the path names of its children, which end up\nbeing duplicated a large number of times.</p>\n<p>The <code>dict</code> is used for deduplication of path names so that the <code>pack</code> file can\nuniquely reference them using shorter identifiers. It is composed of an\nin-memory bidirectional hash table, allowing to query from path to identifier\nwhen serializing and referencing, and from identifier to path when deserializing\nand dereferencing.</p>\n<p>To ensure persistence of the data across multiple runs and in case of crashes,\nthe small size of the <code>dict</code> \226\128\147 less than <code>15 Mb</code> in the Tezos use-case \226\128\147 allows\nus to write the bindings to a write-only, append-only file that is fully read\nand loaded on start-up.</p>\n<p>We guarantee that the <code>dict</code> memory usage is bounded by providing a <code>capacity</code>\nparameter. Adding a binding is guarded by this capacity, and will be inlined in\nthe <code>pack</code> file in case this limit has been reached. This scenario does not\nhappen during normal use of <code>irmin-pack</code>, but prevents attacks that would make\nthe memory grow in an unbounded way.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cec17f425cdf458a385babbac24c0c04/f7171/dict.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 46.470588235294116%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"The `dict`\"\n        title=\"The `dict`\"\n        src=\"/static/cec17f425cdf458a385babbac24c0c04/c5bb3/dict.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cec17f425cdf458a385babbac24c0c04/04472/dict.png 170w,\n/static/cec17f425cdf458a385babbac24c0c04/9f933/dict.png 340w,\n/static/cec17f425cdf458a385babbac24c0c04/c5bb3/dict.png 680w,\n/static/cec17f425cdf458a385babbac24c0c04/b12f7/dict.png 1020w,\n/static/cec17f425cdf458a385babbac24c0c04/b5a09/dict.png 1360w,\n/static/cec17f425cdf458a385babbac24c0c04/f7171/dict.png 3456w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"retrieve-the-data-in-the-pack-by-indexing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#retrieve-the-data-in-the-pack-by-indexing\" aria-label=\"retrieve the data in the pack by indexing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Retrieve the data in the <code>pack</code> by indexing</h3>\n<p>Since the <code>pack</code> file is append-only, naively reading its data would require a\nlinear search through the whole file for each lookup.

It also grows a lot, as the Tezos node\nstores more that 400 million objects. Our memory constraint obviously does not\nallow such unbounded structures. This is where the <code>data</code> part comes in.</p>\n<p>When the <code>log</code> size reaches a \226\128\147 customizable \226\128\147 threshold, its bindings are\nflushed into a <code>data</code> component, that may already contain flushed data from\nformer <code>log</code> overloads. We call this operation a <em>merge</em>.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7663e5dd55a9fa612393be5ae1952bf5/e9c53/merges.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 28.82352941176471%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Merging the index\"\n        title=\"Merging the index\"\n        src=\"/static/7663e5dd55a9fa612393be5ae1952bf5/c5bb3/merges.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7663e5dd55a9fa612393be5ae1952bf5/04472/merges.png 170w,\n/static/7663e5dd55a9fa612393be5ae1952bf5/9f933/merges.png 340w,\n/static/7663e5dd55a9fa612393be5ae1952bf5/c5bb3/merges.png 680w,\n/static/7663e5dd55a9fa612393be5ae1952bf5/b12f7/merges.png 1020w,\n/static/7663e5dd55a9fa612393be5ae1952bf5/b5a09/merges.png 1360w,\n/static/7663e5dd55a9fa612393be5ae1952bf5/e9c53/merges.png 7470w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The important invariant maintained by the <code>merge</code> operation is that the <code>data</code>\nfile must remain sorted by the hash of the bindings.

Whenever\n<code>find</code> or <code>mem</code> is called, we first look into the <code>log</code>, which is simply a call\nto the corresponding <code>Hashtbl</code> function, since this data is contained in memory.\nIf the data is not found in the <code>log</code>, the <code>data</code> file will be browsed. This\nmeans access to recent values is generally faster, because it does not require\nany access to the disk.</p>\n<p>Searching in the <code>data</code> file is made efficient by the invariant that we kept\nduring the <code>merge</code>: the file is sorted by hash. The search algorithm consists in\nan interpolation search, which is permitted by the even distribution of the\nhashes that we store. The theoretical complexity of the interpolation search is\n<code>O(log (log n))</code>, which is generally better than a binary search, provided that\nthe computation of the interpolant is cheaper than reads, which is the case\nhere.</p>\n<p>This approach allows us to find the data using approximately 5-6 reading steps\nin the file, which is good, but still a source of slowdowns. For this reason, we\nuse a fan-out module on top of the interpolation search, able to tell us the\nexact page in which a given key is located, in constant time, for an additional\nspace cost of <code>~100 Mb</code>. We use this to find the correct page of the disk, then\nrun the interpolation search in that page only. That approach allows us to find\nthe correct value with a single read in the <code>data</code> file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This new backend is now used byt the Tezos nodes in production, and manages to\nreduce the storage size from <code>250 Gb</code> down to <code>25 Gb</code>, with a monthly growth\nrate of <code>2 Gb</code> , achieving a tenfold reduction.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, it provides and single writer, multiple readers access pattern\nthat enables bakers and clients to connect to the same storage while it is operated.</p>\n<p>On the memory side, all our components are memory bounded, and the bound is\ngenerally customizable, the largest source of memory usage being the <code>log</code> part\nof the <code>index</code>.

The centerpiece of a GraphQL API is the <em>schema</em>, which describes the graph in terms of types and relationships between these types. The schema is accessible by the consumer, and acts as a contract between the API and the consumer, by clearly defining all API operations and fully assigning types to all interactions.</p>\n<p>Viewing Irmin data as a graph turns out to be a natural and useful model. Concepts such as branches and commits fit in nicely, and the stored application data is organized as a tree. Such highly hierarchical data can be challenging to interact with using REST, but is easy to represent and navigate with GraphQL.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.11764705882352%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAPCAYAAADkmO9VAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAADTElEQVQ4y5WSaWxMURTHz7TWqtbSqlRQPhAaRYmIICIiIXzkG4nlE59ok0pJ0Yits5XZLaFIELHWniCp0lCtmmn7Zp/hdWbem7d1ZlSn6cx17lCxfelN/jnn3nvu7953/g/grzFVZ4YCnVVVqLdCoc5SUqCz7MrXmLfnakzbMN+Na0sLcI+qSGeB/450Og0+jwt8bgbeOOywoeH6iBF1Rpiitx5BkZKz58lswwVCc7zoKdSqofLRs6za5ndACIFUKvUv0OPqBhfTCazXnSlad+EK5KqN1RO0ZjILYQssl8hEzPPVxoe77jRman7XH8OgPQ5eFwNuBNo/fhhjZ5iiwKtnRftu3lq78vL1ihUXr1Ust106sOrKzcptt+5t7vnQUtzDRwslRcmmMDtqnvYsFGhsAJIUUslyODsSDo50dXeBGOVW2zvaHO9a3jSJXORlUuAfsF2Oxm98pDEpRp8goIHjuBser+d1LyHTKXDn7QcjJ+mt2dhjFSCMQiGRECCZ7IWtm9ZPsBlM47Ewhx0ko6GVwI7qmrzaulMzSAnAgbccfVUOatSA/tBksN6FaRoDTKZGUZMQuBSBulg8eiIW47U+b+cNRYnUCEJwjCj2bMRcjVETCnltSi93UpJ69tBXjdOYj83Umdqnas3PJ+os99GsRwgspa87jYcIy3qIx+0ggsASvIQgpBzjE9wnwYCT+H3ddI3ElIisbmqagYfF4jPnyGJbAylFwxBIiutt2ymwigLCYT8e6iJR/vMQcA7GqzRnv7hJwI9AhCty2Fvf3JQLx+sbRtcZXXkaU0eO2tiuOnnGDkfVy+gn5yF00bd+pYyQgbJ4PLoQYaUDAzEVrhehygcHE7iXLMPaxbzAluAnj21jmMOP3783PG1tNb6wO/QtTqeJ4yKrfpnytU+EVPorYB8z874+KROp+tGswVQiUyvKHAiKnBcKBvYHmO4q56eOY6zHXaXwfI0kimuGDmXJciiLxiH9vEj1+14myrwqrvhVcjwyvz8VX9LW1rwlzAdWKAmuXFK+5MNwhiSFhy6aS3tLDQyFfITjgmk6pwYPG4gC2mP6ZyCIOJkO4kfD6ByBxmECf/QUXzMO416EVGGvK+MJoRLnB6lp3wHVMaPbwiwNvgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Git data model\"\n        title=\"Git data model\"\n        src=\"/static/77be7ca8c9940e693b03660d2d5cee01/c5bb3/git-data-model.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/77be7ca8c9940e693b03660d2d5cee01/04472/git-data-model.png 170w,\n/static/77be7ca8c9940e693b03660d2d5cee01/9f933/git-data-model.png 340w,\n/static/77be7ca8c9940e693b03660d2d5cee01/c5bb3/git-data-model.png 680w,\n/static/77be7ca8c9940e693b03660d2d5cee01/5a190/git-data-model.png 800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span>\n(image from <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects\">Pro Git</a>)</p>\n<p>As a consumer of an API, one of the biggest initial challenges is understanding what operations are exposed and how to use them. Conversely, as a developer of an API, keeping documentation up-to-date is challenging and time consuming. Though no substitute for more free-form documentation, a GraphQL schema provides an excellent base line for understanding a GraphQL API that is guaranteed to be accurate and up-to-date. This issue is definitely true of the old Irmin HTTP API, which was hard to approach for newcomers due to lack of documentation.</p>\n<p>Being able to inspect the schema of a GraphQL API enables powerful tooling. A great example of this is <a href=\"graphiql\">GraphiQL</a>, which is a browser-based IDE for GraphQL queries. GraphiQL can serve both as an interactive API explorer and query designer with intelligent autocompletion, formatting and more.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/19632cbb13504bb32d6d6d285ec1f542/82e86/graphiql.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 48.23529411764706%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"GraphiQL\"\n        title=\"GraphiQL\"\n        src=\"/static/19632cbb13504bb32d6d6d285ec1f542/c5bb3/graphiql.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/19632cbb13504bb32d6d6d285ec1f542/04472/graphiql.png 170w,\n/static/19632cbb13504bb32d6d6d285ec1f542/9f933/graphiql.png 340w,\n/static/19632cbb13504bb32d6d6d285ec1f542/c5bb3/graphiql.png 680w,\n/static/19632cbb13504bb32d6d6d285ec1f542/b12f7/graphiql.png 1020w,\n/static/19632cbb13504bb32d6d6d285ec1f542/b5a09/graphiql.png 1360w,\n/static/19632cbb13504bb32d6d6d285ec1f542/82e86/graphiql.png 1978w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The combination of introspection and a strongly typed schema also allows creating smart clients using code generation. This is already a quite wide-spread idea with <a href=\"apollo-swift\">Apollo for iOS</a>, <a href=\"apollo-java\">Apollo for Android</a> or <a href=\"graphql_ppx\"><code>graphql_ppx</code></a> for OCaml/Reason. Though generic GraphQL client libraries will do a fine job interacting with the Irmin GraphQL API, these highlighted libraries will offer excellent ergonomics and type-safety out of the box.</p>\n<p>One of the problems that GraphQL set out to solve is that of over- and underfetching. When designing REST API response payloads, there is always a tension between including too little data, which will require clients to make more network requests, and including too much data, which wastes resources for both client and server (serialization, network transfer, deserialization, etc).<br/>\nThe existing low-level Irmin HTTP API is a perfect example of this. Fetching the contents of a particular file on the master branch requires at least 4 HTTP requests (fetch the branch, fetch the commit, fetch the tree, fetch the blob), i.e. massive underfetching. By comparison, this is something easily solved with a single request to the new GraphQL API. More generally, the GraphQL API allows you to fetch <em>exactly</em> the data you need in a single request without making one-off endpoints.</p>\n<p>For the curious, here's the GraphQL query to fetch the contents of <code>README.md</code> from the branch <code>master</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"graphql\"><pre class=\"language-graphql\"><code class=\"language-graphql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">query</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  master <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    tree <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      get<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token attr-name\">key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"README.md\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The response will look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"data\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"master\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"tree\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"get\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"The contents of README.md\"</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The GraphQL API is not limited to only reading data, you can also write data to your Irmin store. Here's a simple example that will set the key <code>README.md</code> to <code>\"foo\"</code>, and return the hash of that commit:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"graphql\"><pre class=\"language-graphql\"><code class=\"language-graphql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">mutation</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  set<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token attr-name\">key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"README.md\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">value</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"foo\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    hash\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>By default, GraphQL allows you to do multiple operations in a single query, so you get bulk operations for free. Here's a more complex example that modifies two different branches, <code>branch-a</code> and <code>branch-b</code>, and then merges <code>branch-b</code> into <code>branch-a</code> <em>all in a single query</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"graphql\"><pre class=\"language-graphql\"><code class=\"language-graphql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">mutation</span> <span

Because Irmin allows the user to have custom content types, this leaves the question of what type to assign to such values. By default, the GraphQL API will expose all values as strings, i.e. the serialized version of the data that your application stores. This works quite well when Irmin is used as a simple key-value store, but it can be very inconvenient scheme when storing more complex values. As an example, consider storing contacts (name, email, phone, tags, etc) in your Irmin store, where values have the following type:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token comment\">(* Custom content type: a contact *)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> contact <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  name <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  email <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">(* ... *)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Fetching such a value will by default be returned to the client as the JSON encoded representation. Assume we're storing a contact under the key <code>john-doe</code>, which we fetch with the following query:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"graphql\"><pre class=\"language-graphql\"><code class=\"language-graphql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">query</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  master <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    tree <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      get<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token attr-name\">key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"john-doe\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The response would then look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"master\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"tree\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"get\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"John Doe\\\", \\\"email\\\": \\\"john.doe@gmail.com/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> ...<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\"\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The client will have to parse this JSON string and cannot choose to only fetch parts of the value (say, only the email). Optimally we would want the client to get a structured response such as the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"master\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"tree\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"get\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"John Doe\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"email\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"john.doe@gmail.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        ...\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>To achieve this, the new GraphQL API allows providing an \"output type\" and an \"input type\" for most of the configurable types in your store (<code>contents</code>, <code>key</code>, <code>metadata</code>, <code>hash</code>, <code>branch</code>). The output type specifies how data is presented to the client, while the input type controls how data can be provided by the client. Let's take a closer look at specifying a custom output type.</p>\n<p>Essentially you have to construct a value of type <code>(unit, 'a option) Graphql_lwt.Schema.typ</code> (from the <a href=\"ocaml-graphql-server\"><code>graphql-lwt</code></a> package), assuming your content type is <code>'a</code>. We could construct a GraphQL object type for our example content type <code>contact</code> as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token comment\">(* (unit, contact option) Graphql_lwt.Schema.typ *)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> contact_schema_typ <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Graphql_lwt</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Schema</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>obj <span class=\"token string\">\"Contact\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token label function\">~fields</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">fun</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">_</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    field <span class=\"token string\">\"name\"</span>\n      <span class=\"token label function\">~typ</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>non_null string<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"token label function\">~args</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n      <span class=\"token label function\">~resolve</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">fun</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">_</span> contact <span class=\"token operator\">-></span>\n        contact<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>name\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">(* ... more fields *)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>To use the custom type, you need to instantiate the functor <code>Irmin_unix.Graphql.Server.Make_ext</code> (assuming you're deploying to a Unix target) with an Irmin store (type <code>Irmin.S</code>) and a custom types module (type <code>Irmin_graphql.Server.CUSTOM_TYPES</code>).

the underlying data store in real-time. <code>irmin-graphql</code> takes advantage of GraphQL subscriptions to expose Irmin watches. Subscriptions are a relative recent addition to the GraphQL spec (<a href=\"graphql-spec-june-2018\">June 2018</a>), which allows clients to <em>subscribe</em> to changes. These changes are pushed to the client over a suitable transport mechanism, e.g. websockets, Server-Sent Events, or a chunked HTTP response, as a regular GraphQL response.</p>\n<p>As an example, the following query watches for all changes and returns the new hash:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"graphql\"><pre class=\"language-graphql\"><code class=\"language-graphql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">subscription</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  watch <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    commit <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      hash\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>For every change, a message like the following will be sent:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"watch\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"commit\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"hash\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"c01a59bacc16d89e9cdd344a969f494bb2698d8f\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Under the hood, subscriptions in <code>irmin-graphql</code> are implemented using Irmin watches, but this is opaque to the client -- this will work with any GraphQL spec compliant client!</p>\n<p>Here's a video, which hows how the GraphQL response changes live as the Irmin store is being manipulated:</p>\n<p><video controls width=680><source src=\"/blog/2019-11-27-introducing-irmin-graphql/irmin-subscriptions.mp4\" type=video/mp4></video></p>\n<p>Note that the current implementation only supports websockets with more transport options coming soon.</p>\n<h1 id=\"wrap-up\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#wrap-up\" aria-label=\"wrap up permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Wrap-up</h1>\n<p>Irmin 2.0 ships with a powerful new GraphQL API, that makes it much easier to interact with Irmin over the network.

These store handles are held by different processes\n(with disjoint memory spaces) so the instances must use files on disk to\nsynchronise, ensuring that the readers never miss updates from the writer. The\nwriter instance automatically flushes its internal buffers to disk at regular\nintervals, allowing the readers to regularly pick up <code>replace</code> calls.</p>\n<p>Until recently, each time a reader looked for a value \226\128\147 be it a commit, a node,\nor a blob \226\128\147 it first checked if the writer had flushed new contents to disk. This\nensured that the readers always see the latest changes from the writer. However,\nif the writer isn't actively modifying the regions being read, the readers make\none unnecessary system call per <code>find</code>. The higher the rate of reads, the more\ntime is lost to these synchronisation points. This is particularly problematic\nin two use-cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Taking snapshots of the store</strong>. Tezos supports <a href=\"https://tezos.gitlab.io/user/snapshots.html\">exporting portable\nsnapshots</a> of the store data. Since this operation only reads\n<em>historic</em> data in the store (traversing backwards from a given block hash),\nit's never necessary to synchronise with the writer.</li>\n<li><strong>Bulk writes</strong>. It's sometimes necessary for the writer to dump lots of new\ndata to disk at once (for instance, when adding a commit to the history). In\nthese cases, any readers will repeatedly synchronise with the disk even though\nthey don't need to do so until the bulk operation is complete. More on this in\nthe coming months!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To better support these use-cases, we dropped the requirement for readers to\nmaintain strict consistency with the writer instance. Instead, readers can call\nan explicit <code>sync</code> function only when they <em>need</em> to see the latest concurrent\nupdates from the writer instance.</p>\n<p>In our benchmarks, there is a clear speed-up for <code>find</code> operations from readers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[RO] Find in random order with implicit syncs\n        Total time: 67.276527\n        Operations per second: 148640.253086\n        Mbytes per second: 6.378948\n        Read amplification in syscalls: 3.919739\n        Read amplification in bytes: 63.943734\n\n[RO] Find in random order with only one call to sync\n        Total time: 40.817458\n        Operations per second: 244993.208543\n        Mbytes per second: 10.513968\n        Read amplification in syscalls: 0.919588\n        Read amplification in bytes: 63.258072</code></pre></div>\n<p>Not only it is faster, we can see also that fewer system calls are used in the\n<code>Read amplification in syscalls</code> column. The benchmarks consists of reading\n10,000,000 entries of 45 bytes each.</p>\n<p>Relevant PRs: <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/irmin/pull/1008\">irmin #1008</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/index/pull/175\">index #175</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/index/pull/198\">index #198</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/index/pull/203\">index #203</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"better-flushing-for-the-read-write-instance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#better-flushing-for-the-read-write-instance\" aria-label=\"better flushing for the read write instance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Better flushing for the read-write instance</h2>\n<p>Irmin-pack uses an <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/index/\">index</a> to speed up <code>find</code>\ncalls: a <code>pack</code> file is used to store pairs of <code>(key, value)</code> and an <code>index</code>\nrecords the address in pack where a <code>key</code> is stored. A read-write instance has\nto write both the <code>index</code> and the <code>pack</code> file, for a read-only instance to find\na value. Moreover, the order in which the data is flushed to disk for the two\nfiles is important: the address for the pair <code>(key, value)</code> cannot be written\nbefore the pair itself. Otherwise the read-only instance can read an address for\na non existing <code>(key, value)</code> pair. But both <code>pack</code> and <code>index</code> have internal\nbuffers that accumulate data, in order to reduce the number of system calls, and\nboth decide arbitrarily when to flush those buffers to disk.</p>\n<p>We introduce a <code>flush_callback</code> argument in <code>index</code>, which registers a callback\nfor whenever the index decides to flush. <code>irmin-pack</code> uses this callback to flush\nits pack file, resolving the issue of the dangling address.</p>\n<p>Relevant PRs: <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/index/pull/189\">index #189</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/index/pull/216\">index #216</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/irmin/pull/1051\">irmin #1051</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faster-serialisation-for-irmintype\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#faster-serialisation-for-irmintype\" aria-label=\"faster serialisation for irmintype permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Faster serialisation for <code>Irmin.Type</code></h2>\n<p>Irmin uses a library of <a href=\"http://ocamllabs.io/iocamljs/generic_programming.html\"><em>generic</em></a> operations: functions\nthat take a runtime representation of a type and derive some operation on that\ntype. These are used in many places to automatically derive encoders and\ndecoders for our types, which are then used to move data to and from disk. For\ninstance:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">val</span> decode <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'a</span> t <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> string <span class=\"token operator\">-></span> <span class=\"token type-variable function\">'a</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">(** [decode t] is the binary decoder of values represented by [t]. *)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">(** Read an integer from a binary-encoded file. *)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> int_of_file <span class=\"token label function\">~path</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> open_in_bin path <span class=\"token operator\">|></span> input_line <span class=\"token operator\">|></span> decode <span class=\"token module variable\">Irmin</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>int32</code></pre></div>\n<p>The generic <code>decode</code> takes a <em>representation</em> of the type <code>int32</code> and uses\nthis to select the right binary decoder. Unfortunately, we pay the cost of this\nruntime specialisation <em>every time</em> we call <code>int_of_file</code>. If we're invoking\nthe decoder for a particular type very often \226\128\147 such as when serialising store\nvalues \226\128\147 it's more efficient to specialise <code>decode</code> once:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token comment\">(** Specialised binary decoder for integers. *)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> decode_int32 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> decode <span class=\"token module variable\">Irmin</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token module variable\">Type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>int32\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> int_of_file_fast <span class=\"token label function\">~path</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> open_in_bin path <span class=\"token operator\">|></span> input_line <span class=\"token operator\">|></span> decode_int32 contents</code></pre></div>\n<p>The question then becomes: how can we change <code>decode</code> to encourage it to be\nused in this more-efficient way?

It is\nimplemented by removing the old files on disk and opening fresh ones. However\nin <code>irmin-pack</code>, the read-only instance has to detect that a clear occurred. To\ndo this, we add a <code>generation</code> in the header of the files used by an\n<code>irmin-pack</code> store, which is increased by the clear operation.

Because Tezos doesn\226\128\153t require full Git format support,\nwe created a hybrid backend that grabs the best bits of Git (e.g. the\npackfile mechanism) and engineered a domain-specific backend tailored\nfor Tezos usage. Crucially, because of the way Irmin is split into\nclean libraries and OCaml modules, we only had to modify a small part\nof the codebase and could also reuse elements of our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git\">OCaml-git</a> codebase as well.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/irmin/pull/615\">irmin-pack backend</a> is available\nfor <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/irmin/pull/888\">use in the CLI</a> and provides a\nsignificant improvement in disk usage.  There is a corresponding <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/merge_requests/1268\">Tezos merge\nrequest</a> using the Irmin\n2.0 code that has been integrated downstream and will become available via\ntheir release process in due course.</p>\n<p>As part of this development process, we also released an efficient multi-level\nindex implementation (imaginatively dubbed\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/index\">index</a> in opam). Our implementation takes an\narbitrary IO implementation and user-supplied content types and supplies a\nstandard key-value interface for persistent storage. Index provides instance\nsharing by default, so each OCaml runtime shares a common singleton instance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"irmin-graphql-and-browser-irmin\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#irmin-graphql-and-browser-irmin\" aria-label=\"irmin graphql and browser irmin permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Irmin-GraphQL and \226\128\156browser Irmin\226\128\157</h3>\n<p>Another new area of huge interest to us is\n<a href=\"https://graphql.org\">GraphQL</a> in order to provide frontends with a rich\nquery language for Irmin-hosted applications.

These details are mostly described\nby three RFCs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822\">RFC822</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822\">RFC2822</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322\">RFC5322</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though they are cross-compatible, providing full legacy email parsing is an\narchaeological exercise: each RFC retains support for the older design decisions\n(which were not recognized as bad or ugly in 1970 when they were first standardized).</p>\n<p>The latest email-related RFC (RFC5322) tried to fix the issue and provide a better\n<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234\">formal specification</a> of the email format \226\128\147 but of course, it comes with plenty of\n<em>obsolete</em> rules which need to be implemented.

Indeed, currently some implementations of DKIM\nneed 2 passes to verify your email (one to extract the DKIM signature, the other\nto digest some fields and bodies).

More details about these new libraries are also\ngiven below.</p>\n<p>But first, let's focus on <code>ocaml-git</code>'s new design. The primary goal was\nto fix memory consumption issues that our users noticed with the previous version,\nand to make <code>git push</code> work reliably.

We had to make some (performance) compromises to support\nthat use-case, at the benefit of tighter allocation policies \226\128\148 and hence\nmore predictable memory consumption patterns.\nOther Git libraries such as <a href=\"https://libgit2.org/\">libgit2</a>\nalso have to <a href=\"https://libgit2.org/security/\">deal</a> with similar concerns.</p>\n<p>In order to keep a tight control on the allocated memory, we decided to\nuse <a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/decompress\">decompress</a> instead of\n<code>camlzip</code>. <code>decompress</code> allows the users to provide their own buffer\ninstead of allocating dynamically. This allowed us to keep a better\ncontrol on memory consumption. See below for more details on <code>decompress</code>.</p>\n<p>We also used <a href=\"https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom\">angstrom</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/encore\">encore</a> to provide a streaming interface\nto encode and decode Git objects. The streaming API is currently hidden\nto the end-user, but it helped us a lot to build abstraction and, again, on\nmanaging the allocation policy of the library.</p>\n<h2 id=\"complete-pack-file-support-including-gc\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#complete-pack-file-support-including-gc\" aria-label=\"complete pack file support including gc permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Complete PACK file support (including GC)</h2>\n<p>In order to find the right abstraction for manipulating pack files in\na long-lived application, we experimented with\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dinosaure/sirodepac\">various</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dinosaure/carton\">prototypes</a>.

The most important concrete implementation is Git, which\nhas turned into the world\226\128\153s most popular version control system.  In\norder to seamlessly integrate with Irmin, we embarked on an effort to\nbuild a complete re-implementation of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git\">Git from scratch in pure OCaml</a>.</p>\n<p>You can read <a href=\"https://tarides.com/blog/2018-10-19-ocaml-git-2-0.html\">details of the git 2.0 release</a>\non this blog, but from a release engineering perspective we have steadily\nbeen fixing corner cases in this implementation.

But there were also some\nsore points: the granularity of the configuration is the directory not the file,\nand this information is duplicated from the build system configuration (be it\ndune, Makefiles, or, back in the days, ocamlbuild).</p>\n<p>After years of thinking about it, we've finally decided to make some light\nchanges to this process. Since version 3.4, when it scans the filesystem Merlin\nis now looking for either a <code>.merlin</code> file or a dune (or dune-project) file. And\nwhen it finds one of those, it starts an external process in the directory where\nthat file lives, and asks that process for the configuration of the ml(i) file\nbeing edited.</p>\n<p>The process in charge of communicating the configuration to Merlin will either\nbe a specific dune subcommand (when a dune file is found), or a dedicated\n<code>.merlin</code> reader program.</p>\n<p>We see several advantages in doing things this way (rather than, for instance,\nchanging the format of <code>.merlin</code> files):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>this change is entirely backward compatible, and indeed the transition has\nalready happened silently; although dune is still emitting <code>.merlin</code> files,\nthis will only stop with dune 2.8.</li>\n<li>externalizing the reading of <code>.merlin</code> files and simply requiring a\n\"normalized\" version of the config (i.e. with no mention of packages, just of\nflags and paths) allowed us to simplify the internals of Merlin.</li>\n<li>talking to the build system directly not only gets us a much finer grained\nconfiguration (which is important when you build different executables with\ndifferent flags in the same directory, or if you apply different ppxes to\ndifferent files of a library), it opens the door to getting a nicer behavior\nof Merlin in some circumstances. For instance, the build system can (and\ndoes) tell Merlin when the project isn't built. Currently we only report that\ninformation to the user when he asks for errors, alongside all the other\n(mostly rubbish) errors. Which is already helpful in itself. But in the\nfuture we can start filtering the other errors to only report those that\nwould remain even after building the project (e.g. parse errors).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are however some changes to look out for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>people who still use <code>.merlin</code> files but do not install Merlin using opam need\nto make sure to also have the <code>dot-merlin-reader</code> binary in their PATH (it is\navailable as an opam package, but is also buildable from Merlin's git\nrepository)</li>\n<li>vim and emacs users who could previously load packages interactively (by\ncalling <code>M-x merlin-use</code> or <code>:MerlinUse</code>) cannot do that anymore, since Merlin\nitself stopped linking with findlib. They'll have to write a <code>.merlin</code> file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"dropping-support-for-old-versions-of-ocaml\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dropping-support-for-old-versions-of-ocaml\" aria-label=\"dropping support for old versions of ocaml permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Dropping support for old versions of OCaml</h2>\n<p>Until now, every release of Merlin has kept support from OCaml 4.02 to the\nlatest version of OCaml available at the time of that release.</p>\n<p>We have done this by having one version of \"<em>the frontend</em>\" (i.e. handling of\nbuffer state, project configuration; analyses like <em>jump-to-definition</em>,\n<em>prefix-completion</em>, etc.), but several versions of \"<em>the backend</em>\" (OCaml's\nASTs, parser and typechecker), and choosing at build time which one to use.\nThe reason for doing this instead of having, for instance, one branch of Merlin\nper version of OCaml, is that while the backends are fairly stable once\nreleased, Merlin's frontend keeps evolving. Having just one version of it makes\nit easier to add features and fix bugs (patches don't need to be duplicated),\nwhilst ensuring that Merlin's behavior is consistent across every version of\nOCaml that we support.</p>\n<p>For this to work however, one needs a well defined API between the frontend and\nall the versions of the backend. This implies mapping every versions of OCaml's\ninternal ASTs (which receive modifications from one version to the next), to a\nunified one, so as to keep Merlin's various features version agnostic. But it\nalso means being resilient to OCaml's internal API changes. For instance between\n4.02 and 4.11 there were big refactorings impacting: the way one accesses the\ntyping environment, the way one accesses the \"load path\" (the part of the file\nsystem the compiler/Merlin is aware of), the way error message are produced, ...</p>\n<p>The rate of changes on the compiler is a lot higher than what it was when we\nfirst started Merlin (7 years ago now!) which doesn't just mean that we have to\nspend more and more time on updating the common interface, but also that the\ninterface is getting harder to define. Recently (with the 4.11 release) some of\nthe changes were significant enough that for some parts of the backend we just\ndidn't manage to produce a single interface to access old and new versions, so\ninstead we had to start duplicating and specializing parts of the frontend.\nAnd we don't expect things to get much better in the near future.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Merlin's backends are patched to be more resilient to parsing and\ntyping errors in the user's code. Those patches also need to be evolved at each\nnew release of the compiler.\nThe work required to keep the \"unified interface\" working was taking time away\nfrom updating our patches properly, and our support of user errors has slowly\nbeen getting worse over the past few years, resulting in less precise type\ninformation when asked, incomplete results when asking for auto-completion, etc.</p>\n<p>Therefore we have decided to stop dragging older versions of OCaml along. We\nplan to switch to a system where we have one branch of Merlin per version of\nOCaml, and each opam release of Merlin will only be buildable with one version\nof OCaml. We will keep maintaining all the relatively recent branches (that is:\n4.02 definitely will not get fixes, but 4.06 is still in the clear). However,\nall the new features will be developed against the latest version of OCaml and\ncherry-picked to older branches if, and only if, there are no merge conflicts\nand they work as expected without changes.</p>\n<p>We hope that this will make it easier for us to update to new versions of OCaml\n(actually, we already know it does, working on adding support for 4.12 was\neasier than for any of the other recent versions), will allow us to clean up\nMerlin's codebase (let's call that a work in progress), and will free some time\nto work on new features.</p>\n<p>You might wonder what all this changes for you, as a user, in practice. Well, it\ndepends:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you install Merlin from opam: nothing, or almost nothing. Everything that\nyou currently do with Merlin will keep working. In the future, perhaps some\nnew feature will appear that won't work on all versions. But that day hasn't\ncome yet.</li>\n<li>if you install Merlin some other way (manually?): you can't just fetch master\nand build it anymore. You have to pick the appropriate branch for your\nversion of OCaml.</li>\n<li>if you're reusing Merlin's codebase as part of another project and (even\nworse) have patches on it: come and talk to us if you haven't done so already!\nWe can try and integrate your patches, so that you only need to worry about\nvendoring the right version(s) for your needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the years, Merlin has received bugfixes and improvements from a long list of\npeople, but for the upcoming release Fr\195\169d\195\169ric and I are particularly grateful to\nRudi Grinberg, a long time and regular contributor who also maintains the OCaml\nLSP project, as well as Ulysse G\195\169rard, who joined our team a year ago now. They\nare in particular the main authors of the work to improve the handling of\nprojects' configuration.</p>\n<p>We hope you'll be as excited as us by all these changes!</p>"

Looking back at the work accomplished by the MirageOS team, it appears that's\nwhat happened for several years. Re-implementing the entire stack, in particular\nthe lower layers that we often take for granted, requires a great attention to\ndetail. While it may seem reasonably easy to implement a given RFC, a huge\namount of work is often hidden under the surface.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will explain the development process we went through, as we\nupdated a small part of the MirageOS stack: the library <code>ocaml-base64</code>.

Indeed, there\nare cases where two different inputs are associated with the same value:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Base64</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>decode <span class=\"token string\">\"Zm9vCg==\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"foo\\n\"</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Base64</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>decode <span class=\"token string\">\"Zm9vCh==\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"foo\\n\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is mostly because the base64 format encodes the input 6 bits at a time. The\nresult is that 4 base64 encoded bytes are equal to 3 decoded bytes (<code>6 * 4 = 8 * 3</code>). Because of this, 2 base64 encoded bytes provide 1 byte plus 4 bits. What do\nwe need to do with these 4 bits? Nothing.</p>\n<p>That's why the last character in our example can be something else than <code>g</code>. <code>g</code>\nis the canonical byte to indicate using the 2 bits afterward the 6 bits\ndelivered by <code>C</code> (and make a byte - 8 bits). But <code>h</code> can be used where we just\nneed 2 bits at the end.</p>\n<p>Due to this behavior, the check used for fuzzing changes: from a canonical\ninput, we should check isomorphism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"invalid-character\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#invalid-character\" aria-label=\"invalid character permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Invalid character</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above (\"The first problem\"), how should invalid characters be\nhandled? This happens when decoding a byte which is not a part of the base64\nalphabet. In the old version, <code>ocaml-base64</code> would simply leak a <code>Not_found</code>\nexception from <code>String.contains</code>.</p>\n<p>The MirageOS team has taken <a href=\"https://mirage.io/wiki/mirage-3.0-errors\">a stance on exceptions</a>, which is\nto \"use exceptions for exceptional conditions\" - invalid input is hardly one of\nthose. This is to avoid any exception leaks, as it can be really hard to track\nthe origin of an exception in a unikernel. Because of this, several packages\nhave been updated to return a <code>result</code> type instead, and we wanted the new\nimplementation to follow suit.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, exceptions can be useful when considered as a more\nconstrained form of assembly jump.

This\ncode needs to be hidden behind a fancy functional interface. With this in mind,\nwe should assert that our <code>decode</code> function never leaks an exception.

Here's an example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token comment\">(* We want to encode the part 'foo' without prefix or suffix *)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">(* Old API -- forces allocation *)</span>\n<span class=\"token module variable\">Base64</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>encode <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token module variable\">String</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sub <span class=\"token string\">\"prefix foo suffix\"</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Zm9v\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">(* New API -- avoids allocation *)</span>\n<span class=\"token module variable\">Base64</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>encode <span class=\"token label function\">~off</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token number\">7</span> <span class=\"token label function\">~len</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token number\">3</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"prefix foo suffix\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> string <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Zm9v\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Secondly, a new string is allocated to hold the resulting string. We can\ncalculate a bound on the length of this string in the following manner:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ocaml\"><pre class=\"language-ocaml\"><code class=\"language-ocaml\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">//</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> x y <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> y <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">then</span> raise <span class=\"token module variable\">Division_by_zero</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">then</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>x <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> encode input <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> res <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Bytes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>create <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token module variable\">String</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length input <span class=\"token operator\">//</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> decode input <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> res <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token module variable\">Bytes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>create <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token module variable\">String</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length input <span class=\"token operator\">//</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Unfortunately we cannot know the exact length of the result prior to computing\nit. This forces a call to <code>String.sub</code> at the end of the computation to return a\nstring of the correct length. This means we have two allocations rather than\none. To avoid the additional allocation, [@avsm][avsm] proposed to provide a new\ntype <code>sub = string * int * int</code>. This lets the user call <code>String.sub</code> if\nrequired (and allocate a new string), or use simply use the returned <code>sub</code> for\n<em>blit</em>ting to another buffer or similar.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fuzz-everything\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#fuzz-everything\" aria-label=\"fuzz everything permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Fuzz everything!</h1>\n<p>There's a strong trend of fuzzing libraries for MirageOS, which is quite easy\nthanks to the brilliant work by <a href=\"https://github.com/yomimono\">@yomimono</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/stedolan\">@stedolan</a>!\nThe integrated fuzzing in OCaml builds on <a href=\"http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/\">American fuzzy lop</a>, which is\nvery smart about discarding paths of execution that have already been tested and\ngenerating unseen inputs which break your assumptions.

There's an important point to be made though:</p>\n<p><code>ocaml-base64</code> is a small project. Currently, the implementation is about 250\nlines of code. So it's a really small project. But as stated in the\nintroduction, we are fortunate enough to push the restart button of the computer\nworld - yes, we want to make a new operating system.</p>\n<p>That's a massive task, and we shouldn't make it any harder on ourselves than\nnecessary. As such, we need to justify any step, any line of code, and why we\ndecided to spend our time on any change (why we decided to re-implement <code>git</code>\nfor example). So before committing any time to projects, we try to do a deep\nanalysis of the problem, get feedback from others, and find a consensus between\nwhat we already know, what we want and what we should have (in the case of\n<code>ocaml-base64</code>, @hannesm did a look on the PHP implementation and the Go\nimplementation).</p>\n<p>Indeed, this is a hard question which nobody can answer perfectly in isolation.\nSo, the story of this update to <code>ocaml-base64</code> is an invitation for you to enter\nthe arcanas of the computer world through MirageOS :) ! Don't be afraid!</p>"

preset profiles</h1>\n<p>The <code>ocamlformat</code> profile aims to take advantage of the strengths of a parsetree-based auto-formatter,\nand to limit the consequences of the weaknesses imposed by the current implementation.\nThis is a style which optimizes for what the formatter can do best, rather than to match the style of any existing code.\nGeneral guidelines that have directed the design include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legibility, in the sense of making it as hard as possible for quick visual parsing to give the wrong interpretation,\nis of highest priority;</li>\n<li>Whenever possible the high-level structure of the code should be obvious by looking only at the left margin,\nin particular, it should not be necessary to visually jump from left to right hunting for critical keywords, tokens, etc;</li>\n<li>All else equal compact code is preferred as reading without scrolling is easier,\nso indentation or white space is avoided unless it helps legibility;</li>\n<li>Attention has been given to making some syntactic gotchas visually obvious.\n<code>ocamlformat</code> is the new default profile.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>conventional</code> profile aims to be as familiar and \"conventional\" appearing as the available options allow.</p>\n<p>The <code>default</code> profile is <code>ocamlformat</code> with <code>break-cases=fit</code>.\n<code>default</code> is deprecated and will be removed in version 0.10.</p>\n<h1 id=\"ocamlformat-diff-tool\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ocamlformat-diff-tool\" aria-label=\"ocamlformat diff tool permalink\" class=\"anchor

We believe that the secure deployment of blockchains\nis still a major challenge today, and that deploying Tezos as a unikernel will\nhave a big impact in term of safety and security. It will be a key\ndifferentiator that will separate Tezos from other blockchains.</p>\n<p>The Tezos codebase is written in OCaml and is currently using more than 100\nexternal packages, among which one third comes from the MirageOS project.\nHowever, it still heavily depends on non-compatible Unix libraries. Making the\nTezos codebase fully compatible with MirageOS will help Tezos with: distribution\nand packaging, portability, secure deployment and operational safety.</p>\n<p>We\226\128\153ll regularly publish development progress updates, so stay tuned!</p>"
