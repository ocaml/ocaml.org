        <p>We are OCaml Labs Consultancy Ltd. Our company information is at the end of this document.</p>

        <h2>What this is all about</h2>
        <p>These terms and conditions are a contract between you and us for use of this site. They’re available in English only. We’ve tried to make them user-friendly but please note that the summaries/explanations for each section in capitals aren’t a substitute for the rest of the text.</p>

        <p>

          members of that steering committee (past and present) and they have the right to rely on and enforce this agreement including being able to rely on any restrictions on liability.
        </p>

        <p>We do not guarantee that the site will be uninterrupted or error-free and we are not responsible for any losses arising from such interruptions or errors.</p>

        <p>We are entitled, without notice and without liability to suspend the site for repair, maintenance, improvement or other technical reason.</p>

        <p>You acknowledge that technology is not always secure and you accept the risks inherent in use of the Internet or other technology for the purpose of the site.</p>

        <h2>Restrictions on our legal responsibility – very important</h2>
        <p>THIS SECTION LIMITS OUR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY IN VARIOUS WAYS AND MAKES YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTAIN LOSSES WE SUFFER, EG IF YOU BREAK THE CONTRACT</p>

        <p>
          Nothing in this agreement in any way limits or excludes our liability for negligence causing death or personal injury or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or for anything which may not legally be excluded or limited. In this section, any reference to us includes our employees and
          agents, who have the right to enforce this agreement.
        </p>

        <p><em>If you are a Consumer</em>, we shall not be liable for any loss or damage where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>there is no breach of a legal duty owed to you by us;</li>
          <li>such loss or damage was not reasonably foreseeable (meaning it was not an obvious consequence of our breach or not contemplated by you and us at the time we entered into this contract);</li>
          <li>(and to the extent that) such loss or damage is your fault, for example by not complying with this agreement; or</li>
          <li>such loss or damage relates to a business of yours.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>If you are a Consumer</em>, you will be responsible to us for any reasonably foreseeable loss or damage we suffer (including claims made by other people) resulting from your breach of this agreement or misuse of the site.</p>

        <p><em>The following clauses apply only if you are not a Consumer:</em></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In no event (including our own negligence) will we be liable for any of the following (even if we have been advised of the possibility of any such losses): economic losses (including, without limit, loss of revenues, profits, contracts, business or anticipated savings); or loss of
            goodwill or reputation; or special, indirect or consequential losses; or damage to or loss of data.
          </li>
          <li>You will indemnify us against all claims and liabilities arising out of or in connection with your use of the site and/or breach of this agreement (except insofar as we are at fault).</li>
          <li>To the extent allowed by law, you and we exclude all terms, whether imposed by statute or by law or otherwise, that are not expressly stated in this agreement.</li>
          <li>
            This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us with respect to its subject matter and supercedes any previous communications or agreements between us. We both acknowledge that there have been no misrepresentations and that neither of us has relied on any pre-contractual
            statements. Liability for misrepresentation (excluding fraudulent misrepresentation) relating to the terms of this agreement is excluded.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intellectual property rights (IP)</h2>
        <p>THIS SECTION EXPLAINS THAT YOU AND WE REMAIN OWNERS OF COPYRIGHT AND OTHER IP RIGHTS IN OUR RESPECTIVE CONTENT (EXCLUDING OCAML-RELATED SOFTTWARE) AND HOW WE ALLOW EACH OTHER TO USE THAT CONTENT</p>

        <p>
          Note that this section of the terms and conditions does not apply to OCaml-related software made available on this site, but which is initially published elsewhere (e.g., on GitHub/opam) as this is subject to separate licensing arrangements specified by the publisher at the time of upload.
        </p>

        <p>
          You remain the owner of the intellectual property rights in any Content you provide for display on the site such as tutorial videos or documents. You allow us to use your Content on the site to the extent reasonably necessary to operate the site including to make reasonable edits to your
          Content. You also allow each User to use your Content in accordance with these terms and conditions. You give us the right to take any legal action we think necessary if there is an infringement of the intellectual property rights in your Content.
        </p>

        <p>
          We, our partners or other Users own the intellectual property rights in all Content (excluding your Content) used on or in connection with the site. You may view such material on your device only to facilitate your own (or your organisation’s) use of OCaml and related software. You must
          not otherwise use such material including copying, publishing, selling or adapting it or taking extracts from it unless the owner of the IP specifically says so in writing (except to the extent specifically allowed by this agreement). You must not misrepresent the ownership or source of
          such material, for example by changing or removing any legal notices or author attributions.
        </p>

        <p>Just to be clear - you must not collect, scrape, harvest, frame or deep-link to any Content on the site without our specific prior written consent.</p>

        <h2>Your personal information</h2>
        <p>THIS SECTION DIRECTS YOU TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</p>

        <h2>Things we can’t control</h2>
        <p>THIS SECTION EXPLAINS THAT WE AREN’T RESPONSIBLE FOR “ACTS OF GOD”</p>

        <p>We are not liable for failure to perform or delay in performing any obligation under this agreement if the failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond our reasonable control including third party telecommunication failures and epidemics/pandemics.</p>

        <h2>Transferring this contract to someone else</h2>
        <p>THIS SECTION EXPLAINS HOW WE CAN PASS THIS CONTRACT TO SOMEONE ELSE BUT YOU NEED OUR PERMISSION TO DO LIKEWISE</p>

        <p>
          We may transfer all or part of our rights or duties under this agreement provided we take reasonable steps to ensure that your rights under this agreement are not prejudiced. As this agreement is personal to you, you may not transfer any of your rights or duties under it without our prior
          written consent.
        </p>

        <h2>English law and courts</h2>
        <p>THIS SECTION EXPLAINS WHICH COUNTRY’S LAW APPLIES AND WHERE YOU/WE HAVE TO GO TO COURT IF THERE IS A DISPUTE</p>

        <p>
          This contract is under English law and any disputes will be decided only by the courts of the United Kingdom. If you are a Consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident. Nothing in these terms and conditions affects your rights
          as a Consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.
        </p>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>THIS SECTION CONTAINS SOME FINAL GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS CONTRACT WORKS</p>

          We may send all notices under this agreement by email to the most recent email address you have given us. You can send notices to our email address shown below. Headings used in this agreement are for information and not binding. If any part of this agreement is ineffective or
          unenforceable for any reason, the rest of the agreement will still apply. If either of us overlooks any breach of this agreement by the other, it can still be actioned later. A person who is not a party to this agreement can’t enforce it unless the agreement says otherwise. The parties are
          independent contractors and, except as otherwise specifically stated above, nothing in this agreement make any party as agent, employee or representative of the other.
