The pre-processor mode allows to mix documentation and code, and to practice &quot;literate programming&quot; using markdown and OCaml.
The test mode allows to ensure that shell scripts and OCaml fragments in the documentation always stays up-to-date.
<code>ocaml-mdx</code> is released as two binaries called <code>ocaml-mdx</code> and <code>mdx</code> which are the same, mdx being the deprecate name, kept for now for compatibility.</p>

  ; description = {js|<p>dune is a build system that was designed to simplify the release of Jane Street packages. It reads metadata from &quot;dune&quot; files following a very simple s-expression syntax.
dune is fast, has very low-overhead, and supports parallel builds on all platforms. It has no system dependencies; all you need to build dune or packages using dune is OCaml. You don't need make or bash as long as the packages themselves don't use bash explicitly.
dune supports multi-package development by simply dropping multiple repositories into the same directory.
It also supports multi-context builds, such as building against several opam roots/switches simultaneously. This helps maintaining packages across several versions of OCaml and gives cross-compilation for free.</p>

Includes: - An indentor program, callable from the command-line or from within editors - Bindings for popular editors - A library that can be directly used by editor writers, or just for
fault-tolerant/approximate parsing.</p>

OASIS leverages existing OCaml tooling to perform most of it's work. In fact, it might be more appropriate to think of it as simply the glue that binds these other subsystems together and coordinates the work that they do. It should support the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>OCamlbuild - OMake - OCamlMakefile (todo), - ocaml-autoconf (todo)
It also features a do-it-yourself command line invocation and an internal configure/install scheme. Libraries are managed through findlib. It has been tested on GNU Linux and Windows.
It also allows to have standard entry points and description. It helps to integrates your libraries and software with third parties tools like OPAM.

Camlp4 was part of the official OCaml distribution until its version 4.01.0. Since then it has been replaced by a simpler system which is easier to maintain and to learn: ppx rewriters and extension points.</p>
