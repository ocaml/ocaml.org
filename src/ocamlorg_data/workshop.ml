### Scope

The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop will bring together industrial users of OCaml with academics and hackers who are working on extending the language, type system and tools. Discussion will focus on the practical aspects of OCaml programming and the nitty gritty of the tool-chain and upcoming improvements and changes. Thus, we aim to solicit talks on all aspects related to improving the use or development of the language, including, for example:

- compiler developments; new backends, runtime and architectures.

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not exhaustively) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming, or dependent types.

- new library or application releases, and their design rationales.

- tool enhancements by commercial consultants.

- prominent industrial uses of OCaml, or deployments in unusual situations.

It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the meeting, but no formal proceedings for this year. Slides of presentations will be available online from the workshop homepage.

### Questions and contact

If you have any queries or suggestions for the workshop, please contact Didier Remy (first.last@inria.fr) or Anil Madhavapeddy (first.last@cl.cam.ac.uk).

There is also an ASCII version of this information available, suitable for dissemination on mailing lists. Please help spread the word about this meeting!

## Call for presentations (past)

### Scope

Presentations and discussions will focus on the OCaml
programming language and its community. We aim to solicit talks
on all aspects related to improving the use or development of
the language and its programming environment, including, for
example (but not limited to):

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not
  limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,
  or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design
  rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or
  deployments in unusual situations.

### Presentations

It will be an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The
presentation material will be available online from the workshop
homepage. The presentations may be recorded, and made available
at a later time.

The main presentation format is a workshop talk, traditionally
around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, but we also
have a poster session during the workshop -- this allows to
present more diverse work, and gives time for discussion. The
program committee will decide which presentations should be
delivered as posters or talks.

### Submission

To submit a presentation, please register a description of the
talk (about 2 pages long) at <https://icfp-ocaml17.hotcrp.com/>
providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the
presentation: the problems that are addressed, the solutions or
methods that are proposed. If you wish to perform a demo or require any special setup, we will do our best to accommodate you.

LaTeX-produced PDFs are a common and welcome submission
format. For accessibility purposes, we ask PDF submitters to
also provide the sources of their submission in a textual
format, such as .tex sources. Reviewers may read either the
submitted PDF or the text version.

### ML family workshop and post-proceedings

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with general issues of the ML-style programming and type systems, and is seen as more research-oriented. Yet there is an overlap with the OCaml workshop, which we are keen to explore, for instance by having a common session. The authors who feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to mention it at submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

As another form of cooperation, combined post-proceedings of selected papers from the two workshops will be published in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science series. The Program Committees shall invite interested authors of selected presentations to expand their abstract for inclusion in the proceedings. The submissions would be reviewed according to the standards of the publication.

### Questions and contact

If you have any questions, please e-mail: Jacques Garrigue|js}

## Call for presentations (past)

### Scope

Discussions will focus on the practical aspects of OCaml programming and the nitty gritty of the tool-chain and upcoming improvements and changes. Thus, we aim to solicit talks on all aspects related to improving the use or development of the language and of its programming environment, including, for example:

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not
  limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,
  or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design
  rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or
  deployments in unusual situations.

### Submission

It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the meeting, but no formal proceedings. Slides of presentations will be available online from the workshop homepage. The presentations will likely be recorded, and made available at a later time.

To submit a talk, please register a description of the talk (about 2 pages long) at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocaml2015, providing a clear statement of what will be brought by the talk: the problems that are addressed, the technical solutions or methods that are proposed. If you wish to perform a demo or require any special setup, we will do our best to accommodate you.

### ML family workshop and post-proceedings

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with general issues of the ML-style programming and type systems, and is seen as more research-oriented. Yet there is an overlap with the OCaml workshop, which we are keen to explore, for instance by having a common session. The authors who feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to mention it at submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

### Scope

Presentations and discussions will focus on the OCaml
programming language and its community. We aim to solicit talks
on all aspects related to improving the use or development of
the language and its programming environment, including, for
example (but not limited to):

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not
  limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,
  or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design
  rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or
  deployments in unusual situations.

### Presentations

It will be an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The
presentation material will be available online from the workshop
homepage. The presentations may be recorded, and made available
at a later time.

The main presentation format is a workshop talk, traditionally
around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, but we also
have a poster session during the workshop -- this allows to
present more diverse work, and gives time for discussion. The
program committee will decide which presentations should be
delivered as posters or talks.

### Submission

To submit a presentation, please register a description of the
talk (about 2 pages long) at <https://icfp-ocaml17.hotcrp.com/>
providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the
presentation: the problems that are addressed, the solutions or
methods that are proposed. If you wish to perform a demo or require any special setup, we will do our best to accommodate you.

LaTeX-produced PDFs are a common and welcome submission
format. For accessibility purposes, we ask PDF submitters to
also provide the sources of their submission in a textual
format, such as .tex sources. Reviewers may read either the
submitted PDF or the text version.

### ML family workshop and post-proceedings

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with general issues of the ML-style programming and  poster systems, and is seen as more research-oriented. Yet there is an overlap with the OCaml workshop, which we are keen to explore, for instance by having a common session. The authors who feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to mention it at submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

There may be a combined post-conference proceedings of selected papers from the two workshops.

OCaml 2017 will open with an invited talk by three frequent
contributors that recently became maintainers of the OCaml
implementation: David Allsopp
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10OQHsnyg64&index=2&list=TLGGpj_CrU7rr7MxMjAxMjAxOA)),
Florian Angeletti
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOfdGDSypP4&list=TLGGpj_CrU7rr7MxMjAxMjAxOA&index=5)),
and Sébastien Hinderer
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvnyQWZkHS8&list=TLGGpj_CrU7rr7MxMjAxMjAxOA&index=1)).

Due to the high number of high-quality submissions, we had to have
more posters than in previous editions to fit a one-day
schedule. 

## Call for presentations (past)

### Scope

Presentations and discussions will focus on the OCaml
programming language and its community. We aim to solicit talks
on all aspects related to improving the use or development of
the language and its programming environment, including, for
example (but not limited to):

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not
  limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,
  or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design
  rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or
  deployments in unusual situations.

### Presentations

It will be an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The
presentation material will be available online from the workshop
homepage. The presentations may be recorded, and made available
at a later time.

The main presentation format is a workshop talk, traditionally
around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, but we also
have a poster session during the workshop -- this allows to
present more diverse work, and gives time for discussion. The
program committee will decide which presentations should be
delivered as posters or talks.

### Submission

To submit a presentation, please register a description of the
talk (about 2 pages long) at <https://icfp-ocaml17.hotcrp.com/>
providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the
presentation: the problems that are addressed, the solutions or
methods that are proposed.

LaTeX-produced PDFs are a common and welcome submission
format. For accessibility purposes, we ask PDF submitters to
also provide the sources of their submission in a textual
format, such as .tex sources. Reviewers may read either the
submitted PDF or the text version.

### ML family workshop and post-proceedings

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with
general issues of the ML-style programming and type systems,
focuses on more research-oriented work that is less specific to
a language in particular (OCaml). There is an overlap between
the two workshops, and we have occasionally transferred
presentations from one to the other in the past. The authors who
feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to
mention it at submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

We are planning to publish combined post-proceedings and to
invite interested authors of selected presentations to expand
their abstracts for inclusion.
