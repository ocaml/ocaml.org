(* Module to handle Let's Encrypt certificate generation and loading.

   The [load_certificates] function loads the certificates from the filesystem
   if they are found, otherwise, it will send a request to let's encrypt to
   generate a new certificate.

   To verify the identity of the certificate, let's encrypt will send a request
   to a specific endpoint ([/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token}]). The handler
   for this handpoint is the [handler function]. You can add the router [router]
   to your application to dispatch the let's encrypt request correctly. *)
