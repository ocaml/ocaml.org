This document contains the personas we identify while organizing user research and interviewing users.
It is by no means complete and we will add new personas when we identify them.

## Jim

**Age**: 25 years old
**Occupation**: Mid-level developer
**Marital Status**: Single
**Location**: Remote worker

Graduated from University two years ago, Jim started to learn programming at an early age. He wrote his first personal projects with Java and Python before he even entered university. In University, he got exposed to functional programming in OCaml as well as several other programming languages as part of his course work. He learned to like OCaml as a language with a strong type system that provides safety guarantees. For the last six years, he has been using OCaml, TypeScript and Rust for personal and company projects. By now, his experience with different languages allows him to pick up new syntaxes and languages quickly.

He is working as a freelancer since he prefers to have the freedom of choosing his clients and coding with statically typed languages like OCaml, TypeScript, Rust. He enjoys delivering features for exciting clients, particularly for Start-Ups. He gets bored quickly and likes to manage his time at his convenience. He spends time on forums, OCaml discuss and Stack Overflow, Reddit and Discord to find answers or useful additional explanations and details. He is not afraid of looking at the source code of packages to estimate code quality and to learn how the internals work. He knows he is good at programming and not interested in leading people. He is well aware of his market value as a freelancer. 

Once, he created a package but he is not particularly interested in spending time on growing a community around that package. He prefers to browse packages when he has a specific task to solve. He has certain packages and authors that he trusts. He likes packages with guidance, clear documentation and a helpful community. When a package is not well structured and documented, he moves on quickly.

### Dislike and Frustration

- When a client is unclear on what needs to be done.
- When a client rejects OCaml as a programming language choice
- Documentation that does not get to the point
- Bad package APIs, unobvious behaviour of the implementation

### Motivation and Goal

- Earn Money.
- Add different projects, knowledge and skills to his resume.
- Always looking for better frameworks, tools, and ways of doing things to build more reliable software in a shorter time.
- Deliver secure and safe projects with little maintenance.

## Nelly

**Age**: 18 years old
**Occupation**: Student
**Marital Status**: Single
**Location**: Campus resident

For a year, Nelly has been studying computer science in University. She is a total beginner at programming and is discovering and learning OCaml as part of her coursework. Her objective this year is to learn OCaml so that she can get good grades for her programming class - and later on a well paying job as a developer. The class she is taking teaches basic programming skills in OCaml using only the Standard Library.

Nelly uses the OCaml Learning resources and tutorials when she gets stuck while trying to solve the exercises given by her instructor. She also reads the book the instructor recommended to the students.

With the guidance of the OCaml learn area, she has managed to install OCaml on Windows. Around 70% of the time, she manages to fix mistakes in her code using the resources available to her. In case she cannot fix the mistake herself, she asks her tutor because she still feels too insecure to ask beginner questions in larger groups or on public forums. 

Besides, Nelly is a curious student and works hard to reach her goal. She is more talented than she gives herself credit for, and the instructor recognizes that. For her BSc degree, she chooses to implement a project in OCaml, coming in contact with the OCaml package ecosystem for the first time.

### Dislike and Frustration

- Sometimes underestimates the time needed to complete the exercises, may struggle to meet deadlines to turn in her solutions.
- Frustrated when she cannot figure out the solution to the exercises
- Spending weeks writing code only to realise at the end that all of that was not needed or could be replaced by two lines of code.

### Motivation and Goal

- Improve and stabilise OCaml knowledge.
- Get her diploma.
- Get a well paying job in a good company doing work that fascinates her.

## Eugene

**Age**: 38 years old
**Occupation**: Team Lead
**Marital Status**: Single
**Location**: 2 days a week office

Eugene has a MSc in computer science from a prestigious university. After graduating, he has worked for a few different start-ups and corporations that use OCaml. He has gained a lot of experience and is a technical expert on the OCaml language, tools, and package ecosystem.

Eugene has decided to take a team lead position as the next step in his career, so now he is managing 6 developers with various experience levels, from junior to senior.

He is able to flag risk and anticipate business needs, provides recommendations and advice to his team with specific OCaml tools, packages or implementation techniques. He does know various strong and healthy packages and has favourite package authors. 

To avoid project failure, he communicates with stakeholders and his team and keeps track of tasks and issues to measure progress. He has established a process of best practice. Analyses and planning, task distributions, implementation, code review, testing and documentation for maintenance and future updates.

He wants a productive and efficient team to be able to work on tight deadlines or complex features and have a successful delivery.

Since he started working in his new role 8 months ago, he regrets no longer finding enough time to improve the packages he published earlier in his career.

### Dislike and Frustration

- Miscommunication between team members.
- When a package the product depends on becomes deprecated or has security vulnerabilities.
- When team members disregard his advice and ship broken features into production.

### Motivation and Goal

- Deliver successful features on time.
- Collaborate with the product team to understand user needs and to avoid having to later redo work.
- Smooth and organised process well documented.

## Carl

**Age**: 38 years old
**Occupation**: Instructor and Academic researcher
**Marital Status**: N/A
**Location**: N/A

Carl is a professor at University. He was appointed 3 years ago. His research intersects with programming language theory, specifically functional programming. He holds beginner and advanced programming lectures using a curriculum built on the OCaml language.

For the beginner lectures, he takes inspiration from the OCaml curriculums of prestigious research universities to create course materials for his students. For the advanced lectures, he creates course materials that challenge the students to code specific projects that involve authentic tasks.

Beginner lectures rely only on the OCaml Standard Library, but not on external packages. Carl provides detailed installation instructions on how to set up the OCaml environment, and how to use the OCaml environment installed on the computers available in the department’s computer rooms. Lessons and exercises focus on learning the syntax and semantics of the OCaml language as well as basic algorithms.

For the advanced courses, he prepares project templates and provides installation instructions to ensure that the students do not struggle unnecessarily with setup and package installation. By providing the students with environments where they can focus on solving problems according to the lecture topic and matching their expected level of programming ability, he enables them to quickly improve and build confidence. The projects allow students to make some implementation choices so they can build advanced coding skills using (almost always pre-selected) packages from the OCaml ecosystem.
 
Carl is active in the OCaml community. He sometimes provides feedback to package authors, in order to help make a package more usable and understandable by his students. He likes when packages are well-structured and documented with titles, descriptions and code examples.

### Dislike and Frustration

- Packages lacking documentation require him to write his own instructions for his students so they can use the package in a project.
- Students do not read the recommended books.
- Students do not code neatly and do not add comments to their code.

### Motivation and Goal

- Keep students motivated.
- Provide engaging education materials.
- Passing knowledge.
