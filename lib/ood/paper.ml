The syntax definition should provide a good  basis for experiments with the design of OCaml and the development of further tooling.

  ; abstract = {js|LexiFi maintains an OCaml compiler extension that enables introspection through runtime type representations.  Recently, we implemented a syntax extension (PPX) that enables the use of LexiFi runtime types on vanilla compilers.  We propose to present our publicly available runtime types and their features. Most notably, we want to present  a mechanism for pattern matching on runtime types with holes.

  ; abstract = {js|SmartPy is a complete system to develop smart-contracts for the Tezos blockchain. It is an embedded EDSL in python  to write contracts and their tests scenarios. It includes an online IDE, a chain explorer, and a command line interface.  Python is used to generate programs in an imperative, type inferred, intermediate language called SmartML. SmartML is  also the name of the OCaml library which provides an interpreter, a compiler to Michelson (the smart-contract language of Tezos),  as well as a scenario “on-chain” interpreter. The IDE uses a mix of OCaml built with js_of_ocaml and pure Javascript.  The command line interface also builds with js_of_ocaml to run on Node.js.

  ; abstract = {js|OCaml-CI is a CI service for OCaml projects. It uses metadata from the project’s opam and dune files to work out what to build,  and uses caching to make builds fast. It automatically tests projects against multiple OCaml versions and OS platforms. The CI has been deployed on around 50 projects so far on GitHub, and many of them see response times an order of magnitude quicker than  with less integrated CI solutions. This talk will introduce the CI service and then look at some of the technologies used to build it.

  ; abstract = {js|This proposal describes a presentation to be given at the OCaml’20 workshop. The presentation will cover a new OCaml filesystem,  ImpFS, and the related libraries. The filesystem makes use of a B-tree library presented at OCaml’17, and a key-value store  presented at ML’19. In addition, there are a number of other support libraries that may be of interest to the community. ImpFS  represents a single point in the filesystem design space, but we hope that the libraries we have developed will enable others to  build further filesystems with novel features.

  ; abstract = {js|Odoc is the latest attempt at creating a documentation tool which handles the full complexity of the OCaml language. It has been a long  time coming as tackling both the module system and rendering into rich documents makes for a difficult task. Nevertheless we believe  the two recent developments provides the final pieces of the OCaml documentation puzzle. This two improvements split odoc in two  layers: a model layer, with a deep understanding of the module system, and a document layer allowing for easy definition of new outputs.

  ; abstract = {js|Coda is a new cryptocurrency that uses zk-SNARKs to dramatically reduce the size of data needed by nodes running its protocol. Nodes communicate  in a format automatically derived from type definitions in OCaml source files. As the Coda software evolves, these formats for sent data may change. We wish to allow nodes running older versions of the software to communicate with newer versions. To achieve that, we identify stable types that  must not change over time, so that their serializations also do not change.
