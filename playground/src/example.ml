  Welcome to OCaml Play, the official OCaml playground!

  You don't need to install anything on your local machine -
  just write your code here and see the results immediately
  in the Output panel.

  It's also compatible with OCaml 5: you can use it to try
  the new Domain module and the effect handlers. Below is an
  example that calculates the Fibonacci sequence in parallel.
  
  Happy hacking!
