# To Do

Overview:

- [X] We don't have the data for IO and fd, remove these
- [X] The uptime doesn't have the right format
- [X] Need to validate CPU and Memory usage (they don't seem correct)

Analytics:

- [X] Items in the navbar are not properly highlighted
- [X] Top Pages is hard-coded
- [X] Select "Last 30 days" is not usable

Others:

- [ ] Re-write the Privacy Policy

Milestone 2:

- [ ] Add salt to hashing of the IP
- [ ] Add Locations
- [ ] Add Devices
- [ ] Add Statistics
- [ ] Add Total visitor count
- [ ] Add Top Sources
- [ ] Remove data after 30 days

Next:

- Details on opened file descriptors
- Input/Output
- Logs
- Load data from filesystem to keep the analytics between deployments
