# How to Contribute

Welcome to OCaml.org's contributing guide. Thank you for taking the time to read it! Your help with OCaml.org is extremely welcome. We are particularly motivated to support new contributors and people who are looking to learn and develop their skills. If you get stuck, please don’t hesitate to [ask questions on Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/new).

This guide documents the best way to contribute to the project when adding things listed below in Contributing Content. If you're looking for a guide on how to setup the project and suggest a change to the code, you can refer to our [HACKING](./HACKING.md) guide, which will also give instructions on how to rebuild the website when making changes, if necessary.

- **Good First Issues**: if you are either new to the repository or still getting started with OCaml in general, issues marked as a `good first issue` are ideal.
- **Suggesting Changes**: most of the site content is stored in the `data` directory as Markdown or YAML. To suggest a change or update this content, you can edit those files directly and rebuild the website, detailed in the [HACKING](./HACKING.md) guide. This will promote the content into their `.ml` counterparts. If you would like to suggest entirely new website content or code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues) to discuss it first.
- **Implementing Pages**: most pages are implemented in `src/ocamlorg_frontend/pages` using the [.eml templating preprocessor](https://aantron.github.io/dream/#templates). This is mixture or OCaml and HTML.

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests. Feel free to open an issue over [here](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/new) if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

Please include images and browser-specific information if the bug is related to some visual aspect of the site. This tends to make it easier to reproduce and fix.

The following sections give more details on how to contribute.

### <a name="images"></a>Adding Images

Some of the data that can be contributed by users may include images or other media; e.g., success stories, academic and industrial users, or books.

Images can be added to the corresponding subfolder in the `data/media/` folder.

For example, to add a university logo associated with an academic institution, you have to add the image file to the `data/media/academic_institution/` folder.

Videos or other media should not be added to the OCaml.org GitHub repository.

### <a name="ocaml-planet"></a>Add Your RSS Feed or YouTube Channel to the OCaml Planet

Anyone can contribute to the [OCaml Planet](https://ocaml.org/ocaml-planet), which is composed of three types of content:

- Community blog posts fetched from RSS feeds
- Videos fetched from YouTube channels
- Original blog posts linked from original source

#### Add Your RSS Feed

If you write about OCaml and have an RSS or Atom feed, you can add your feed to [`data/planet-sources.yml`](data/planet-sources.yml).

When compiling, the feed entries will be downloaded, and Markdown files for each item will be created in [`data/rss`](data/rss/). For instance: [building-ahrefs-codebase-with-melange.md`](data/rss/ahrefs/building-ahrefs-codebase-with-melange.md).

If you enable the `publish_all: true` flag in `data/planet-sources.yml`, you must make sure your feed only contains articles about OCaml.

#### Add Your YouTube Channel

If you have a YouTube channel and publish videos about OCaml (mention "OCaml" in the description of every video that should appear on the OCaml Planet!), you can add your channel to [`data/youtube.yml`](data/youtube.yml).

#### Link Original Blog Post

To contribute an individual link to your original blog post to the OCaml Planet, add a new Markdown file in [`data/planet/-individual_external_links/`](data/planet/-individual_external_links/).

Create a `.md` file with the following header:

```
---
title: Title of Your Self-Hosted Post Here (title case)
description: one-sentence description
url: direct URL to your original blog post
date: 2023-06-13  (this format)
preview_image: direct link to preview image
---
```

### <a name="content-job"></a>Add an Entry to the Job Board

> Contribute to the [Job Board](https://ocaml.org/jobs).

The job board displays OCaml job opportunities.

To add a new entry to the job board, you can add it to [`data/jobs.yml`](data/jobs.yml).

Please make sure that the job involves mostly writing OCaml. Contributions to add jobs unrelated to OCaml, or where OCaml is a negligible part of the job, won't be accepted.

If you notice that a job opportunity is outdated (e.g., already fulfilled or not open anymore), we also welcome PRs to remove it.

### <a name="content-success-story"></a>Add a Success Story

> Contribute to the [Success Stories](https://ocaml.org/success-stories).

You can contribute a new success story by adding a Markdown file in [data/success_stories/](data/success_stories/). For instance: [janestreet.md](data/success_stories/janestreet.md).

The success stories should be structured in the following way:

- An overview of your company
- The challenge you faced and solved
- The solution you implemented, which should describe the role OCaml played in solving the challenge
- A post-mortem describing the results you had after implementing the solution

You can read [Ahref's Success Story](https://ocaml.org/success-stories/peta-byte-scale-web-crawler) for a good example.

### <a name="content-academic-user"></a>Add an Academic User

> Contribute to the [Academic Users](https://ocaml.org/academic-users).

You can add a new academic user by creating a new Markdown file in [data/academic_institutions/](data/academic_institutions). When submitting an academic institution to our webpage, please structure the data as follows:

Information about the institution
- **`name`**: The full name of the academic institution.  
- **`description`**: A brief overview of the institution, including its background and key details.  
- **`url`**: The official website of the institution.  
- **`logo`**: A link to the institution’s logo image.  
- **`continent`**: The continent where the institution is located.  

A list of courses available at the institution. Each course entry must include:  
- **`name`**: The full name of the course.  
- **`acronym`**: The course code or identifier.  
- **`url`**: A direct link to the course webpage.  

Location
- **`lat`**: The latitude of the institution’s location.  
- **`long`**: The longitude of the institution’s location. 

For instance: [cornell.md](data/academic_institutions/cornell.md).

### <a name="content-industrial-user"></a>Add an Industrial User

> Contribute to the [Industrial Users](https://ocaml.org/industrial-users).

Add a new industrial user by creating a new Markdown file in [data/industrial_users/](data/industrial_users/). When submitting an industrial user to our webpage, please structure the data as follows:
  
Information about the organization
- **`name`**: The full name of the organization.  
- **`description`**: A brief overview of the organization, including its mission and key details.  
- **`logo`**: A link to the organization’s logo image.  
- **`url`**: The official website of the organization.  

Locations  
- A list of countries where the organization operates.  

Additional Information  
- **`consortium`**: Indicates whether the organization is part of a consortium (`true` or `false`).  
- **`featured`**: Indicates whether the organization is highlighted as a featured entity (`true` or `false`). 

For instance: [cryptosense.md](data/industrial_users/cryptosense.md).

### <a name="content-book"></a>Add a Book

> Contribute to the [OCaml Books](https://ocaml.org/books).

Add a new OCaml book by creating a new Markdown file in [data/books/](data/books/). For instance: [ocaml-from-the-very-beginning.md](data/books/ocaml-from-the-very-beginning.md).

### <a name="content-cookbook"></a>Add a Recipe to the OCaml Cookbook

The OCaml Cookbook is a place where OCaml developers share how to solve common
tasks in OCaml using packages from the OCaml ecosystem.

Here are the steps to contribute a recipe for an existing task:
- Find the task in the [data/cookbook/tasks.yml](data/cookbook/tasks.yml) file.
- Go to the task folder inside [data/cookbook/](data/cookbook/) that has the
  same name as the task's `slug`.
- Create a `.ml` file containing the recipe and a YAML header with metadata about
  the recipe.

If the recipe does not fit into any existing task, you also need to create a
task. Add a `task:` entry in [data/cookbook/tasks.yml](data/cookbook/tasks.yml)
file. Fields `title`, `description`, and `slug` are mandatory. The task must be
located under a relevant `category:` field.

Finally, it is also possible to create and organise groups of tasks by creating
new categories. Categories are recursive and may have subcategories, which are
full categories too. A task listed in
[data/cookbook/tasks.yml](data/cookbook/tasks.yml) may have no recipes yet. On the
other hand, it is not allowed to have a task folder in
[data/cookbook/](data/cookbook/) that does not correspond to a task from the
[data/cookbook/tasks.yml](data/cookbook/tasks.yml) file because it triggers a
compilation error.

Each recipe is a way to perform a task using a combination of open-source
libraries.

#### Guidelines for New OCaml Cookbook Recipes

When contributing new recipes to the OCaml Cookbook, please adhere to the following:

1. **Task Selection**:
   - Focus on practical, reusable tasks relevant to a wide audience.
   - Ensure the task demonstrates idiomatic OCaml usage.
   - Avoid tasks that are overly trivial or highly specific to niche cases.

2. **Code Standards**:
   - Write clear, idiomatic OCaml code.
   - Ensure the code compiles without errors or warnings.
   - Use standard OCaml libraries and tools wherever possible.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Does the recipe address a useful real-world task?
   - Is the code ready for production use?
   - If using a package, does it implicitly recommend the package for production?
   - Avoid duplicating existing recipes unless demonstrating package differences.

Following these guidelines will help us maintain a high-quality and consistent OCaml Cookbook.

### <a name="content-recurring-event"></a>Add A Recurring Event

> Contribute a [Recurring Event](https://ocaml.org/community).

You can add a new recurring event by adding it to the YAML file [data/events/recurring.yml](data/events/recurring.yml).

### <a name="content-upcoming_event"></a>Add an Upcoming Event

> Contribute to the [Upcoming Event](https://ocaml.org/community).

You can add a new upcoming event by creating a new Markdown file in [data/events/](data/events/).

### <a name="content-changelog"></a>OCaml Changelog

The [OCaml Changelog](https://ocaml.org/changelog) is a user-oriented blog that serves as a newsfeed for the OCaml ecosystem. It's important to note that despite its name, it's not a traditional changelog, but rather a curated blog of significant updates and news about the stable OCaml tooling.

The Changelog covers developments across:

- [The OCaml Compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml)
- [OCaml Platform Tools](https://ocaml.org/docs/platform)
- [OCaml Infrastructure](https://infra.ocaml.org/)
- [OCaml.org itself](https://ocaml.org/)

#### Purpose and Audience

The primary audience for the Changelog is OCaml users. Content should focus on changes, updates, and news that directly impact users of OCaml and its ecosystem.

Good candidates for Changelog posts include:

1. Announcements of new releases
2. Significant feature additions or changes
3. Important updates to OCaml.org that affect user experience
4. Infrastructure changes that impact users
5. Regular updates on ongoing development as part of Developer Previews

The Changelog is not meant for:

1. Internal refactoring that doesn't result in user-visible changes
2. Highly technical details that are only relevant to OCaml core developers
3. Sharing complete changelogs (although there is a `changelog` tag where you can include the changelogs as part of release announcements)

#### Contributing a Post

To contribute a new post to the Changelog:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `data/changelog/` directory.
2. Use a clear, descriptive filename (e.g., `2025-08-26-ocaml-eglot-brings-lsp-support-to-emacs.md`).
3. Include relevant metadata at the top of the file (title, tags, etc.).
4. Write the post content, focusing on how the news or change affects OCaml users.
5. Submit a pull request with your new file.

### <a name="content-backstage"></a>Backstage OCaml

As a dual to the OCaml Changelog, Backstage OCaml is a channel TODO

#### Contributing a Post

To contribute a new post to Backstage OCaml:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `data/backstage/` directory.
2. Use a clear, descriptive filename (e.g., `2025-06-05-portable-external-dependencies-for-dune-package-management.md`).
3. Include relevant metadata at the top of the file (title, tags, etc.).
4. Write the post content, focusing on how the news or change affects OCaml users.
5. Submit a pull request with your new file.

### <a name="content-platform-tools-release"></a>Platform Tools Releases

As part of the [OCaml Changelog page](https://ocaml.org/changelog) and the [Backstage OCaml page](https://ocaml.org/backstage), we list stable, and respectively, unstable releases of all the OCaml Platform tools, as well as the OCaml compiler.

#### Contributing Release Notes

To contribute OCaml Platform Tools release notes:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `data/platform_releases/` directory.
2. Use a clear, descriptive filename (e.g., `2025-02-03-dune-release-2.1.0.md`).
3. Include relevant metadata at the top of the file (title, tags, etc.).
4. Submit a pull request with your new file.

## Git and GitHub Workflow

The preferred workflow for contributing to a repository is to fork the main repository on GitHub, clone, and develop on a new branch.

If you aren't familiar with how to work with Github or would like to learn it, here is [a great tutorial](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Feel free to use any approach while creating a PR. Here are a few suggestions from the Dev team:

- If you are not sure whether your changes will be accepted or want to discuss the method before delving into it, please create an issue and ask.
- Clone the repo locally (or continue editing directly in GitHub if the change is small). Checkout
  out the branch that you created.
- Create a draft PR with a small initial commit. Here's how you can [create a draft pull request.](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
- Continue developing and feel free to ask questions in the PR if you run into obstacles or uncertainty as you make changes.
- Review your implementation according to the checks noted in the PR template.
- Once you feel your branch is ready, change the PR status to "ready to review."
- Consult the tasks noted in the PR template.
- When merging, consider cleaning up the commit body.
- Close any issues that were addressed by this PR.

## Troubleshooting

### After rebase, my branch doesn't build anymore

Please check in the commit log whether an upgrade of the dependencies (advancing of the `opam-repository` commit hash) has happened. If this is the case, running `dune pkg lock` should install the new dependencies.
